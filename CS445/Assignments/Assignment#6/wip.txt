Assignment 5:
IfK case in codegenStatement()

Advice from BC for assignment 6
- Says to solve the first diff which is for a missing main function by creating a type global main_found 
  variable and setting it initialy to false and having a condition for setting it true when main is found
  and then after the tree treversal, if main_found is true then no error, and if it is false, then 
  trigger an error

Assignment 6:
where do I signal and record the error 
Cascade up the tree - wont look for errors after the first - what section of the code would I do this (semantics.cpp and parser.y)
is there a tiny yyerror file
relevant resources/documents, textbook

Assignment 6 Lecture:
Pg 9 - yyerrok 
10 - is error a nonterminal which needs to be defined, does yyparse() trigger be the error keyword
