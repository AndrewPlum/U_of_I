Python - DNA scanner

Your task is to write a program that reads in a file listing a sequence of DNA 
(represented as text) and translate the DNA code into the amino acid code which 
it represents. 

There are four (4) different nucleotide molecules found in a strand of DNA: 
    Adenine (A), 
    Thymine (T), 
    Guanine (G), and 
    Cytosine (C). 
The nucleotides always occur in bonded pairs which connect two strands together 
to form the well-known double-helix shape. However, for the purpose of 
transcription, we are only interested in one strand at a time. A single 
(unbonded) strand of DNA may contain any of the four nucleotides arranged in 
any order. Thus, essentially, a strand of DNA represents a base-4 coding system. 

In order to ensure proper transcription, the code needs to have special codons 
that represent "start" and "end". The start codon ensures that the transcription 
process is properly aligned and reads correct groups of 3 nucleotides. The stop 
codon ensures that the process does not continue indefinitely, building an ever 
larger chain of amino acids. 

There is one start codon:
   ATG

There are three end codons:
   TAA
   TAG
   TGA

Your mission is to create a python program to scan dna.txt for each start codon
and report the line and character posistion. 
When a start has been found, scan until an end codon is found.
Repete until the end of the file is reached and then report the number of 
complete sequences found. The end of your output will look something like this:

Start Line 4075:21 CTAGAGGTAGACGACCAGGCGATGGCGAAACTTGATGTAGGACGTGTCTA
End Line 4075:32 CTAGAGGTAGACGACCAGGCGATGGCGAAACTTGATGTAGGACGTGTCTA

End Line 4081:25 AGGGTGCAAGCTAGACATTAATGTTTAGCTTCATCCAAGCGAACTGTGGC
Start Line 4083:4 GTTAATGTTTGC

Your program should take the name of the input file as a parameter, so running 
your program will look something like this:

python w14.py /y/shared/Engineering/cs-drbc/assignments/cs210/dna.txt
