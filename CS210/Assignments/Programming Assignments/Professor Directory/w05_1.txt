YACC - Continued

Building off of your previous weekly assignment add the following:

1.)  Add a right-associative # operator, at higher precedence than + and -.
     This is an imaginary new perator that adds the second number+1.
2.)  Then add a left-associative < operator, at higher precedence than any 
     of the others except () and -. This operator is also imaginary, but it is
     the equivelent of the ^. I.e, 3^4 = 3<4 = powf(3,4)

Note: to do < use powf. You will need to include:
#include <math.h>

Note: These operators must come last in your .l file. I.e:
[-+()*/#<]                      {return yytext[0];}
