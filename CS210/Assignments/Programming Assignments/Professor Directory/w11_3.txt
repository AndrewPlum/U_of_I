C++ Dynamic Binding

Create a file (it must be called w10.cpp). In this file create three classes:

Animal

Dog (a subclass of Animal)

PetDog (a subclass of Dog)

For each class, create three methods, Speak1, Speak2 and Speak3. Each methood 
shoule pring out the method name and the class name. For example PetDog will 
something like this:

class PetDog: public Dog
{
   public:
     void Speak1(){ cout << "Speak1 PetDog" << endl; }
     void Speak2(){ cout << "Speak2 PetDog" << endl;}
     void Speak3(){ cout << "Speak3 PetDog" << endl;}
};

At the top of your file you will need these two lines:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

Now for the FUN part. Some of my methods are declared virtual, others are not.
Reverse engineer what I have done (based on my output) and make your's match mine.
