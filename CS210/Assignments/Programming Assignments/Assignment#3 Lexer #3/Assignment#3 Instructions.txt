Lexer: Character Literals and Comments

This assignmet builds off the previous one. In this assignemnt you are to
expand your previous code to recognize character literals and comments in CCX.
   Character Literal
      Character literals in CCX are literals in single-quotes like this: ’x’.
      This should just be an extension of the strings you identified in the
      previous assignment.

   Comments:
      Comments in CCX begin with /* and end with */ (C-style comments).
      Comments can span multiple lines. Everything encountered between (and
      including) the /* and */ delimiters is considered part of the comment
      lexeme.

Note: We will be putting this assignment asside for the next two weeks, but
we will come back to it after we have completed YACC. Be sure to keep a copy of
this file for future reference.
