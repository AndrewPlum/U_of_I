SML Patterns

Create 2 functions in sml:
 - member (''a * ''a list -> bool)
      returns true if a is a member of the list

 - split (int * int list -> int list * int list)
      takes an integer (pivot) and a list of integers and splits the list into 2 sublists.
        - the first sublist will have all the integers that are < pivot
        - the second sublist will have all the integers that are > pivot
      This frunction must maintain teh original order of the elements.

Note: This assignment will give you 2 marks for the proper output. The remaining
8 marks will be for using patterns correctly,
