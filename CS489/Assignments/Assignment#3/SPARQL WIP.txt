SPARQL Final Query.txt:
# Things to check / question:
# 1) For some reason, not all presidents are being included as vice presidents in the result if
#    they were vice president as well as president. Vice presidents who were not president 
#    are being included. Millard Fillmore who was both is being included though. Examples
#    of those who arent are Nixon, Lyndon Johnson
# 2) Not all presidents are being returned (eg Martin Van Buren), and this might be the case for 
#    vice presidents. Why is this? Is it missing data? Run simple queries returning all in 
#    president and vice president lists.
# 3) Was OPTIONAL implemented correctly?
# 4) Not returning TermStart for Joe Biden?
# 5) With COUNT AS and GROUP BY I think I am having trouble getting both to work together. 
#    Look at temp.txt
# 6) STREND technically used in a filter but it kind of covers a case already covered by another 
#    filter using REGEX. Should I change it so it just uses STREND?

- SELECT	QQQ
- WHERE		QQQ
- DISTINCT	QQQ
- COUNT AS	SEMI
- FILTER	QQQ
- OPTIONAL	SEMI - NOT SURE IF COMPLETLY CORRECT, MIGHT BE A BETTER ONE
- UNION		QQQ
You are also required to use at least two keywords from this list: 
- ORDER BY	QQQ
- GROUP BY	SEMI
- HAVING
- LIMIT     	QQQ
You are also required to use at least three keywords from this list:
