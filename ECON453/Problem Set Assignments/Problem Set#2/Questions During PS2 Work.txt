Questions:
1)	Does explanatory power still matter when the dependent variable measured is logged? I would assume so but how so because you are predicting percentages? 
a.	Likewise does the constant matter and what does it mean in our regression where the dependent variable is logged?
2)	Comparing the p-values the regression at the beginning of 5 where economics is the reference category and to the p-values in the test for equality where it is between economics and accounting. They are very similar p-values but slightly different. Does this mean anything? Should they be the same or similar at all?
