2018-02-13,2662.94,"Chair_Powell_2018-Feb-13",0.261295180722894,"it is both humbling and a great privilege to be standing here today.1 i am particularly honored by the trust and faith that the president has placed in me and by the senate's quick action in confirming me. there is no greater honor than public service, as randy, lael and all of our colleagues here at the fed would agree.    the congress has assigned the federal reserve the goals of stable prices and maximum employment. price stability means that businesses and households can make important decisions without concern for high or volatile inflation. maximum employment means that those who want a job either have one or can find one reasonably quickly. we also have important responsibilities for the stability of the financial system and for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including our largest banks. through regulation that is both effective and efficient, we seek to ensure that credit, which is vital for a healthy economy, will be available to families and businesses throughout the business cycle, so they can invest in a brighter future.    these are awesome responsibilities, and the congress has wisely entrusted us with an important degree of independence so that we can pursue our monetary policy goals without concern for short-term political pressures. as a public institution, we must be transparent about our actions so that the public, through its elected representatives, can hold us accountable. over the past 25 years, the fed has been a leader among central banks in improving transparency. today, we are open and accountable. we strive to explain our actions in a way that enhances the public's understanding of our goals and methods. we will continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary policy and in regulation.    when i joined the board of governors in 2012, unemployment was 8.2 percent. many millions of americans were still suffering from the ravages of the crisis. since then, monetary policy has continued to support a full recovery in labor markets and a return to our inflation target; we have made great progress in moving much closer to those statutory objectives. in addition, the financial system is incomparably stronger and safer, with much higher capital and liquidity, better risk management, and other improvements.    much credit for these results should go to chairman bernanke and chair yellen. i am grateful for their leadership and for their example and advice as colleagues. but there is more to the story than successful leadership. the success of our institution is really the result of the way all of us carry out our responsibilities. we approach every issue through a rigorous evaluation of the facts, theory, empirical analysis and relevant research. we consider a range of external and internal views; our unique institutional structure, with a board of governors in washington and 12 reserve banks around the country, ensures that we will have a diversity of perspectives at all times. we explain our actions to the public. we listen to feedback and give serious consideration to the possibility that we might be getting something wrong. there is great value in having thoughtful, well-informed critics.    while the challenges we face are always evolving, the fed's approach will remain the same. today, the global economy is recovering strongly for the first time in a decade. we are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance sheet with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives. we will also preserve the essential gains in financial regulation while seeking to ensure that our policies are as efficient as possible. we will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability.    i am deeply grateful for the opportunity to lead the fed as we face these evolving challenges. i believe that the way we approach our work, the strong values we hold, and the dedication to public service i see throughout the federal reserve have been the keys to our success. as chairman, i will uphold these values and do my very best to further our pursuit of something we all seek--an economy that works for all americans."
2018-04-06,2604.47,"Chair_Powell_2018-Apr-6",-2.19202054948853,"for more than 90 years, the economic club of chicago has provided a valued forum for current and future leaders to discuss issues of vital interest to this city and our nation. i am honored to have the opportunity to speak to you here today.    at the federal reserve, we seek to foster a strong economy for the benefit of individuals, families, and businesses throughout our country. in pursuit of that overarching objective, the congress has assigned us the goals of achieving maximum employment and stable prices, known as the dual mandate. today i will review recent economic developments, focusing on the labor market and inflation, and then touch briefly on longer-term growth prospects. i will finish with a discussion of monetary policy.    recent developments and the state of the economy  after what at times has been a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the great recession, growth has picked up. unemployment has fallen from 10 percent at its peak in october 2009 to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades (figure 1). seventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job growth remains more than sufficient to employ new entrants to the labor force (figure 2). the labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and i on the federal open market committee (fomc) expect it to remain strong. inflation has continued to run below the fomc's 2 percent objective but we expect it to move up in coming months and to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.    beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength. steady income gains, rising household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence continue to support consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of economic output. business investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both business surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead. fiscal stimulus and continued accommodative financial conditions are supporting both household spending and business investment, while strong global growth has boosted u.s. exports.    as many of you know, each quarter fomc participants--the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the reserve banks--submit their individual projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, which the committee uses as the primary tool of monetary policy. these individual projections are compiled and published in the summary of economic projections, or sep. fomc participants submitted their most recent forecasts three weeks ago, and those forecasts show a strengthening in the medium-term economic outlook (table 1). as you can see, participants generally raised their forecasts for growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (gdp) and lowered their forecasts for unemployment. in addition, many participants expressed increased confidence that inflation would move up toward our 2 percent target. the fomc sees the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.    the state of the labor market  as i mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen since 2000. the median projection in the march sep calls for unemployment to fall well below 4 percent for a sustained period, something that has not happened since the late 1960s. this strong labor market forecast has important implications for the fulfillment of both sides of the dual mandate, and thus for the path of monetary policy. so i will spend a few minutes exploring the state of the job market in some detail.    a good place to begin is with the term ""maximum employment,"" which the committee takes to mean the highest utilization of labor resources that is sustainable over time. in the long run, the level of maximum employment is not determined by monetary policy, but rather by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market.1 also, the level of maximum employment is not directly measureable, and it changes over time. real-time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2 recognizing this uncertainty, the fomc does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment. instead, we look at a wide range of indicators to assess how close the economy is to maximum employment.    the headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor market conditions. in addition, it is widely known and updated each month. as i noted, the unemployment rate is currently at 4.1 percent, which is a bit below the fomc's median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. however, the unemployment rate does not paint a complete picture. for example, to be counted in the official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past four weeks.3 people who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as unemployed, but as out of the labor force, even though some of them actually want a job and are available to work. others working part time may want a full-time job. and still others who say that they do not want a job right now might be pulled into the job market if the right opportunity came along. so, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also look at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as well as measures of vacancies and job flows, surveys of households' and businesses' perceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices.    figure 3 shows the headline unemployment rate and two broader measures of unemployment, known as u-5 and u-6.4 u-5 includes the unemployed plus people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the past year (though not in the past four weeks). u-6 includes all those counted in u-5 plus people who are working part time but would like full-time work. like the headline unemployment rate, both u-5 and u-6 have declined significantly in recent years. they are now at levels seen before the financial crisis, though not quite as low as they were in 1999 to 2000, a period of very tight job market conditions.    the left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much difficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago (figure 4). likewise, the job vacancy rate, shown on the right, is close to its all-time high, as is the average number of weeks it takes to fill a job opening.5 households also are increasingly reporting that jobs are plentiful (figure 5), which is consistent with the high level of job postings reported by firms. in addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that others are confident enough about their prospects to leave jobs voluntarily--even before they have landed their next job.    while the data i have discussed thus far do point to a tight labor market, other data are less definitive. the labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of working age individuals who are either working or actively looking for a job, has remained steady for about four years (figure 6). this flat performance is actually a sign of improvement, since increased retirements as our population ages have been putting downward pressure on participation and will continue to do so. however, the participation rate of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 54) has not recovered fully to its pre-recession level, suggesting that there might still be room to pull more people into the labor force (figure 7). indeed, the strong job market does appear to be drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time. for example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force after previously reporting that they were not working because of a disability has increased over the past couple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to take on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6    wage growth has also remained moderate, though it has picked up compared with its pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8). weak productivity growth is an important reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years. at the same time, the absence of a sharper acceleration in wages suggests that the labor market is not excessively tight. i will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further.    taking all of these measures of labor utilization on board, what can we say about the state of the labor market relative to our statutory goal of maximum employment? while uncertainty around the long run level of these indicators is substantial, many of them suggest a labor market that is in the neighborhood of maximum employment. a few other measures continue to suggest some remaining slack. assessments of the maximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision. as we seek the highest sustainable utilization of labor resources, the committee will be guided by incoming data across all of these measures.    inflation  that brings me to inflation--the other leg of our dual mandate. the substantial improvement in the labor market has been accompanied by low inflation. indeed, inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 9). consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in february. the core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.6 percent over the same period. in fact, both of these indexes have been below 2 percent consistently for the past half-dozen years. this persistent shortfall in inflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the phillips curve. given how low the unemployment rate is, why aren't we seeing higher inflation now?    as those of you who carefully read the minutes of each fomc meeting are aware--and i know there are some of you out there--we had a thorough discussion of inflation dynamics at our january meeting. almost all of the participants in that discussion thought that the phillips curve remained a useful basis for understanding inflation. they also acknowledged, however, that the link between labor market tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, reflecting in part the extended period of low and stable inflation in the united states and in other advanced economies. participants also noted that other factors, including inflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect inflation.    my view is that the data continue to show a relationship between the overall state of the labor market and the change in inflation over time. that connection has weakened over the past couple of decades, but it still persists, and i believe it continues to be meaningful for monetary policy. much of the shortfall in inflation in recent years is well explained by high unemployment during the early years of the recovery and by falling energy prices and the rise in the dollar in 2015 and 2016. but the decline in inflation last year, as labor market conditions improved significantly, was a bit of a surprise. the 2017 shortfall from our 2 percent goal appears to reflect, at least partly, some unusual price declines, such as for mobile phone plans, that occurred nearly a year ago. in fact, monthly inflation readings have been firmer over the past several months, and the 12-month change should move up notably this spring as last spring's soft readings drop out of the 12-month calculation. consistent with this view, the median of fomc participants' projections in our march survey shows inflation moving up to 1.9 percent this year and to 2 percent in 2019.    longer-run challenges  although job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the u.s. economy continues to face some important longer-run challenges. gdp growth has averaged just over 2 percent per year in the current economic expansion, much slower than in previous expansions. even the higher growth seen in recent quarters remains below the trend before the crisis. nonetheless, the unemployment rate has come down 6 percentage points during the current expansion, suggesting that the trend growth necessary to keep the unemployment rate unchanged has shifted down materially. the median of fomc participants' projections of this longer-run trend growth rate is 1.8 percent. the latest estimate from the blue-chip consensus of private forecasters is about 2 percent.7    to unpack this discussion a little further, we can think of output growth as composed of increases in hours worked and in output per hour, also known as productivity growth. here, a comparison with the 2001-to-2007 expansion is informative. output growth in that earlier expansion averaged nearly 3 percent per year, well above the pace in the current expansion. despite the faster output growth, however, average job growth in the early 2000s was 1/2 percentage point per year weaker than in the current expansion. the difference, of course, is productivity, which grew at more than twice the pace in the early 2000s than it has in recent years.    taking a longer view, the average pace of labor productivity growth since 2010 is the slowest since world war ii and about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 10). moreover, the productivity growth slowdown seems to be global and is evident even in countries that were little affected by the financial crisis (figure 11). this observation suggests that factors specific to the united states are probably not the main drivers.    as shown in figure 12, labor productivity growth can be broken down into the contributions from business investment (or capital deepening), changes in the skills and work experience of the workforce, and a residual component that is attributed to other factors such as technological change and efficiency gains (usually lumped together under the term total factor or multifactor productivity).    in the united states and in many other countries, some of the slowdown in labor productivity growth can be traced to weak investment after the crisis. investment has picked up recently in the united states, however, which suggests that capital deepening may pick up as well. the other big contributor to the slowdown has been in total factor productivity growth. the outlook for this dimension of productivity is considerably more uncertain. total factor productivity growth is notoriously difficult to predict, and there are sharply different views on where it might be heading. some argue that the productivity gains from the information technology revolution are largely behind us, and that more-recent technological innovations have less potential to boost productivity.8 others argue that a well-documented decline in measures of business dynamism--such as the number of start-ups, the closure of less-productive businesses, and the rates at which workers quit their jobs and move around the country to take a new job--has held back productivity growth, in part by slowing the movement of capital and labor toward their most productive uses.9    new technological breakthroughs in many areas--robotics, biotech, and artificial intelligence to name just a few--have led others to take a more optimistic view.10 they point to substantial productivity gains from innovation in areas such as energy production and e-commerce. in addition, the optimists point out that advances in technology often take decades to work their way into the economy before their ultimate effects on productivity are felt. that delay has been observed even for game-changing innovations like the steam engine and electrification, which ultimately produced broad increases in productivity and living standards. in this view, we just need to be patient for new technologies to diffuse through the economy. only time will tell who has the better view‑‑the record provides little basis to believe that we can accurately forecast the rate of increase in productivity.    the other principal contributor to output growth is hours worked. hours growth, in turn, is largely determined by growth in the labor force, which has averaged just 1/2 percent per year since 2010, well below the average in previous decades (figure 13). one reason for slower growth of the labor force is that baby boomers are aging and retiring, and that trend will continue. but another reason is that labor force participation of people between the ages of 25 and 54--prime-age individuals--declined from 2010 to 2015 and remains low. indeed, the participation rate for prime-age men has been falling for more than 50 years, while women's participation in this age group rose through the 1990s but then turned downward, and it has fallen for the past 20 years.    these trends in participation have been more pronounced in the united states than in other advanced economies. in 1990, the united states had relatively high participation rates for prime-age women relative to other countries and was in the midrange of advanced economies for prime-age men. however, we now stand at the low end of participation for both men and women in this age group--just above italy, but well below germany, france, and spain (figure 14).    there is no consensus about the reasons for the long-term decline in prime-age participation rates, and a variety of factors could have played a role.11 for example, while automation and globalization have contributed positively to overall domestic production and growth, adjustment to these developments has resulted in dislocations of many workers without college degrees and those employed in manufacturing. in addition, factors such as the increase in disability rolls in recent decades and the opioid crisis may have reduced the supply of prime-age workers. given that the declines have been larger here than in other countries, it seems likely that factors specific to the united states have played an important role. as i noted earlier, the strong economy may continue to pull some prime-age individuals back into the labor force and encourage others not to drop out. research suggests that structurally-oriented measures--for example, improving education or fighting the opioid crisis--also will help raise labor force participation in this age group.12    to summarize this discussion, some of the factors weighing on longer-term growth are likely to be persistent, particularly the slowing in growth of the workforce. others are hard to predict, such as productivity. but as a nation, we are not bystanders. we can put policies in place that will support labor force participation and give us the best chance to achieve broad and sustained increases in productivity, and thus in living standards. these policies are mostly outside the toolkit of the federal reserve, such as those that support investment in education and workers' skills, business investment and research and development, and investment in infrastructure.    monetary policy  let me turn now to monetary policy. in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the fomc went to extraordinary lengths to promote the recovery, support job growth, and prevent inflation from falling too low. as the recovery advanced, it became appropriate to begin reducing monetary policy support. since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, waiting until inflation and employment hit our goals before reducing policy support could have led to a rise in inflation to unwelcome levels. in such circumstances, monetary policy might need to tighten abruptly, which could disrupt the economy or even trigger a recession.    as a result, to sustain the expansion, the fomc adopted a gradual approach to reducing monetary policy support. we began in december 2015 by raising our target for the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade. since then, with the economy improving but inflation still below target and some slack remaining, the committee has continued to gradually raise interest rates. this patient approach also reduced the risk that an unforeseen blow to the economy might push the federal funds rate back near zero‑‑its effective lower bound--thus limiting our ability to provide appropriate monetary accommodation.    in addition, after careful planning and public communication, last october the fomc began to gradually and predictably reduce the size of the fed's balance sheet. reducing our securities holdings is another way to move the stance of monetary policy toward neutral. the balance sheet reduction process is going smoothly and is expected to contribute over time to a gradual tightening of financial conditions. over the next few years, the size of our balance sheet is expected to shrink significantly.    at our meeting last month, the fomc raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. this decision marked another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation. the fomc's patient approach has paid dividends and contributed to the strong economy we have today.    over the next few years, we will continue to aim for 2 percent inflation and for a sustained economic expansion with a strong labor market. as i mentioned, my fomc colleagues and i believe that, as long as the economy continues broadly on its current path, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals. it remains the case that raising rates too slowly would make it necessary for monetary policy to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion. but raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would remain persistently below our 2 percent objective. our path of gradual rate increases is intended to balance these two risks.    of course, our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook. if the outlook changes, so too will monetary policy. our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all americans--one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation."
2018-05-08,2671.92,"Chair_Powell_2018-May-8",-0.0265655926933409,"thank you for inviting me to join you today as part of this distinguished panel.    our subject is the relationship between ""center country"" monetary policy and global financial conditions, and the policy implications of that relationship both for the center country and for other countries affected. this broad topic has been the subject of a great deal of research and discussion in recent years. today i will focus in particular on the role of u.s. monetary policy in driving global financial conditions and capital flows. to preview my conclusions, i will argue that, while global factors play an important role in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of u.s. monetary policy is often exaggerated. and while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more resilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks.    the well-known mundell-fleming ""trilemma"" states that it is not possible to have all three of the following things: free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy. the trilemma does not say that a flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from external shocks.1 and, indeed, that is not the case. we have seen that integration of global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they have fixed or floating exchange rate regimes.    since the fed is the central bank of the world's largest economy and issuer of the world's most widely used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the fed's policy actions will spill over to other economies. to illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the left side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following federal reserve policy announcements. as you can see, changes in u.s. interest rates after fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis). and because of the dollar's widespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions abroad. fed policy-related movements in u.s. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond yields abroad, such as the german yields shown in the scatterplot on the right. such spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2 as figure 2 shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move together fairly closely.    but the influence of u.s. monetary policy on global financial conditions should not be overstated. the federal reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect global financial markets. in fact, the united states is the recipient as well as the originator of monetary policy spillovers. for example, as seen in figure 3, changes in german yields after european central bank policy decisions also pass through to u.s. yields.3 more broadly, it is notable that although the fed has raised its target interest rate six times since december 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall u.s. domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global conditions and central bank policy abroad.    much of the discussion of the spillovers of u.s. monetary policy focuses on their effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (emes). some observers have attributed the movements in international capital flowing to emes since the global financial crisis primarily to monetary stimulus by the fed and other advanced-economy central banks.4 the data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well. as illustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel of figure 4, capital flows to emes were already very strong before the global financial crisis, when the federal funds rate was comparatively high. the subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was abating, largely reflects a rebound from the capital flow interruption during the crisis itself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless also played a role. moreover, capital flows to emes started to ease after 2011, a period when the federal reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through increases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel. and, more recently, capital flows to emes have picked up again despite the fact that the fed has been removing accommodation since 2015.    if u.s. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been driving eme capital flows? one prominent factor has been growth differentials between emes and advanced economies. in figure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to emes picked up post-crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing. another related determinant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel. the pickup in both global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of the recent recovery of capital flows to emes.5    monetary stimulus by the fed and other advanced-economy central banks played a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to emes in recent years. there is good reason to think that the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies should continue to prove manageable for emes. fed policy normalization has proceeded without disruption to financial markets, and market participants' expectations for policy (the red symbols in figure 6) seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers' expectations in the summary of economic projections (the black dots), suggesting that markets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with expectations.    it also bears emphasizing that the emes themselves have made considerable progress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s. many emes have substantially improved their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks while adopting more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better insulation from external financial shocks.6 corporate debt at risk--the debt of firms with limited debt service capacity--has been rising in emes, as shown in figure 7.7 but this rise has been relatively limited outside of china and has begun to reverse as stronger global growth has pushed up earnings.    all that said, i do not dismiss the prospective risks emanating from global policy normalization. some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate. and, of course, future economic conditions may surprise us, as they often do.    moreover, the linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of global financial markets are not fully understood. some observers have argued that u.s. monetary policy also influences capital flows through its effects on global risk sentiment, with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy depressing sentiment.8 while those channels may well operate, research at both the fed and the imf suggests that actions by major central banks account for only a relatively small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9    nevertheless, risk sentiment will bear close watching as normalization proceeds around the world. what can the federal reserve do to foster continued financial stability and economic growth as normalization proceeds? we will communicate our policy strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid market disruptions. and we will continue to help build resilience in the financial system and support global efforts to do the same."
2018-05-25,2721.33,"Chair_Powell_2018-May-25",-0.23572455054698,"thank you for inviting me here to celebrate this important milestone. today is a special day for all of us, since the founding of the riksbank 350 years ago marked the beginning of central banking.1 as we meet to discuss the challenges and opportunities the future may hold, it is worth pausing to note that the three and a half centuries since the riksbank's founding have seen economic growth and dynamism the breadth and duration of which have been unprecedented in world history. the swedish innovation we celebrate today, i believe, is a vital part of the financial foundations that support the continuation of rising prosperity.    in my comments today, i will explore the road ahead for public transparency and accountability of central banks in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions in many places around the world. as you know, the importance of transparency and accountability to monetary policymaking was recognized and became firmly entrenched in practice over the past few decades. the riksbank has been a leader in this transparency revolution. today i will focus on the less-often emphasized but critically important role transparency and accountability play in regulatory and financial stability policies.    to preview my conclusions, public transparency and accountability around both financial stability and monetary policy have become all the more important in light of the extraordinary actions taken by central banks in response to the global financial crisis. financial stability policymaking has evolved from managing individual crises as they arise to establishing a policy framework that emphasizes prevention. this framework now includes measures to increase the resiliency of the financial system; enhanced monitoring of financial institutions and of building risks to the system; and measures, such as resolution planning, that require firms to take steps today to better prepare for future episodes of stress. these innovations have placed special demands on transparency and accountability, and we have worked hard to explain them to the public. the framework is still evolving, and we will need to be open to making changes and to new ways to enhance transparency and accountability.    government, central banking, and independence  this is a challenging moment for central banking. opinion polls show that trust in government and public institutions is at historic lows.2 in this environment, central banks cannot take our measure of independence for granted.    for monetary policy, the case for central bank independence rests on the demonstrated benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from shorter-term political considerations. but for a quarter century, inflation has been low and inflation expectations anchored. we must not forget the lessons of the past, when a lack of central bank independence led to episodes of runaway inflation and subsequent economic contractions.    as for financial stability, the crisis and the severe recession that followed revealed serious flaws at many private and public institutions, including shortcomings in supervision and regulation. the crisis and its aftermath led central banks to take extraordinary actions, actions that challenged the ingenuity of experts in the field and were understandably difficult to explain and justify to a skeptical public. while these actions were authorized by law and on the whole necessary to avert the complete collapse of the financial system's ability to service households and businesses, they may have also contributed to the erosion of public trust.    central banks are assigned narrow but important mandates. for monetary policy, the fed's mandate is to keep inflation low and stable and to achieve maximum employment. for financial sector supervision and regulation, part of our mandate is to foster the safety and soundness of individual institutions. in addition, we have a responsibility, shared with other government agencies, to promote financial stability. i view this responsibility as being highly complementary to other aspects of our mission: financial stability promotes sustainable economic growth, and a stable, well-functioning financial system is an effective transmission channel for monetary policy. indeed, there can be no macroeconomic stability without financial stability.    within our narrow mandates, to safeguard against political interference, central banks are afforded instrument independence‑‑that is, we are given considerable freedom to choose the means to achieve legislatively-assigned goals. while the focus is often on monetary policy independence, research suggests that a degree of independence in regulatory and financial stability matters improves the stability of the banking system and leads to better outcomes.3 for this reason, governments in many countries, including the united states, have granted some institutional and budgetary independence to their financial regulators.    financial stability, transparency and accountability  in a democratic system, any degree of independence brings with it the obligation to provide appropriate transparency. in turn, transparency provides an essential basis for accountability and democratic legitimacy by enabling effective legislative oversight and keeping the public informed.4 of course, central banks also need to stick closely to our mandates; the case for independence weakens to the extent that central banks stray into issues that the legislature has not assigned to us.5    there is also an important policy effectiveness argument in favor of transparency. in the financial stability arena, there is no better example of this than the role that the first round of stress tests played during the crisis in restoring confidence in the u.s. banking system.6 so in the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just about being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system.    the post-crisis regulatory system recognizes the importance of enhanced transparency, both about financial institutions themselves and about the processes and expectations of regulators and supervisors. before the crisis, supervision focused on the safety and soundness of individual institutions and was insufficiently attentive to risk in the financial system as a whole. supervisory judgments about firms were shared with the public only in rare and exceptional circumstances. financial stability tools were deployed after the fact, to address specific events that emerged to threaten stability. it is an understatement to say that this approach proved inadequate in the crisis.    the post-crisis regime has shifted to implementing preventive policies well in advance of any crisis.7 newly established ex ante policies include building the resilience of institutions by requiring more and higher-quality capital and liquidity buffers; a regime of stress tests undertaken by supervisors; and resolution planning, which requires firms to analyze their own potential for distress or failure and create a plan to be used in the event of bankruptcy. these post-crisis policies have benefitted from public solicitation of feedback and in many cases from consideration in open meetings of the board of governors.    transparency and incorporation of public feedback in these areas have produced more effective supervision and regulation. for example, transparent and clearly communicated policies make it easier for regulated entities to know what is expected of them and how best to comply. of course, as with any large-scale, complex undertaking, the standards adopted over the past decade can undoubtedly be improved. at the fed, we are committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post-crisis reforms.    in a sense, stress testing is itself a step forward in transparency. pre-crisis, supervisors' views of the risks facing our most systemically important firms--and the firms' ability to understand and survive these risks--were shrouded in secrecy. post-crisis, as part of our stress-testing regime, these supervisory views and expectations are transparent. we expect that these firms will have capital, liquidity, and risk-management capabilities that are adequate for the firms not only to survive, but to continue to perform their key functions even in the event of truly severe stress, akin to the global financial crisis. we make a great deal of information regarding the stress tests public, including the scenarios we use, portfolio-level projected losses for participating firms, and, of course, the results. we have also proposed for public comment a range of ways to further enhance the transparency of the supervisory stress tests. this detailed disclosure provides the public with a wealth of information on how these institutions would perform under severe stress. and this transparency both enhances public confidence and holds banking regulators accountable for their judgments.    at the federal reserve we use a variety of additional means to enhance public understanding of our supervisory and financial stability efforts and judgments. the board's vice chairman for supervision testifies before the congress twice a year. the board staff's assessment of financial stability is discussed four times a year at federal open market committee meetings, and these discussions are summarized in the meeting's published minutes. and, since 2013, the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress has contained a review of financial stability conditions.    the way forward  the post-crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar. some of these new policies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and challenging for all involved. as a result, transparency and accountability around financial stability tools present particular challenges. we will continue to strive to find better ways to enhance transparency around our approach to preserving financial stability. efforts to engage with the public‑‑including consumer groups, academics, and the financial sector‑‑are likely to lead to improved policies. moreover, ongoing dialogue will work to enhance public trust, as well as our ability to adapt to new threats as they emerge.    there is every reason to expect that technology and communications will continue to rapidly evolve, and to affect the financial system and financial stability in ways that we cannot fully anticipate. while future innovations may well improve the delivery of financial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of potential future systemic vulnerabilities. we will need to keep up with the pace of innovation, which will doubtless require changes to our approach to financial stability. as we consider such changes, it will remain critically important to provide transparency and accountability. by doing so, we strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy that enables central banks to serve the needs of our citizens, in the long and proud tradition of the riksbank."
2018-06-20,2767.32,"Chair_Powell_2018-Jun-20",0.17121614137458,"nine years into an expansion that has sometimes proceeded slowly, the u.s. economy is performing very well. growth is meaningfully above most estimates of its long-term trend--though admittedly, that trend is not as strong as we would like it to be. the labor market is particularly robust, with unemployment at its lowest level since april 2000. inflation has moved up close to our 2 percent objective, although we have yet to see it remain near that objective on a sustained basis.    today, most americans who want jobs can find them. high demand for workers should support wage growth and labor force participation--the latter a measure on which the united states now lags most other advanced economies.1 a tight labor market may also lead businesses to invest more in technology and training, which should support productivity growth. and groups such as some racial and ethnic minorities that still have higher unemployment and lower participation rates could see increasing benefits from a tight labor market.2 in short, there is a lot to like about low unemployment.    achieving our statutory goal of maximum employment in a context of price stability and financial stability is both our responsibility and our challenge. earlier in the expansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary policy was clear. but with unemployment low and expected to decline further, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.    current labor market conditions  at 3.8 percent, the unemployment rate is below most estimates of its long-run level, which are now clustered in the mid-4s. many other labor market indicators also suggest an economy near full employment. to name just a few, these indicators include an elevated level of job vacancies. for the first time since the labor department began collecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people counted as unemployed. in addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is elevated, a sign that workers are able to find another job when they seek one. and surveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies, and that households perceive jobs as plentiful.    some other indicators are less clear. the labor force participation rate of prime-age workers has moved up in recent years but remains below pre-crisis levels.3 in addition, wage growth has been moderate, consistent with low productivity growth but also an indication that the labor market is not excessively tight.    looking ahead, the job market is likely to strengthen further. real gross domestic product in the united states is now reported to have risen 2-3/4 percent over the past four quarters, well above most estimates of its long-run trend. expansionary fiscal policy is expected to add to aggregate demand over the next few years. many forecasters expect the unemployment rate to fall into the mid-3s and to remain there for an extended period. if that comes to pass, it will mean the lowest unemployment in the united states since the late 1960s.    a historical comparison  because we have so little experience with very low unemployment, it is interesting to compare today's labor market with that earlier period. unemployment was below 4 percent from february 1966 through january 1970. during that time, inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased from below 2 percent in 1965 to about 5 percent in 1970. in hindsight, unemployment is now widely thought to have been unsustainably low at that time and to have contributed to escalating inflation.    but how significant is this precedent for today? the u.s. economy has changed in many ways over the past 50 years. by some estimates, the natural rate of unemployment is substantially lower now.4 for example, the congressional budget office now estimates that the natural rate was about 5‑3/4 percent (and rising) in the late 1960s, compared with 4-3/4 percent at present.5    rising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s, because more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed. the share of the population with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to nearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined from 45 percent to about 5 percent.6 another important difference from the 1960s is that inflation has been low and stable for an extended period, which has better anchored inflation expectations. today policymakers have a greater appreciation of the role expectations play in inflation dynamics and a clearer commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation.    unfortunately, with the passage of a half-century and important changes in the structure of our economy and in central bank practices, in my view the historical comparison does not shed as much light as we might have hoped.    questions prompted by a tight labor market  the lack of useful historical precedent leaves us with some uncertainty about the answers to several important and challenging questions. first, estimates of the natural rate of unemployment by federal open market committee (fomc) participants and others have drifted lower as unemployment has declined without much apparent reaction from inflation. how reliable are these estimates? natural rate estimates have always been uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has become less responsive to the unemployment rate.7 the anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and has likely played a role in flattening the phillips curve. but a flatter phillips curve makes it harder to assess whether movements in inflation reflect the cyclical position of the economy or other influences.    second, what would be the consequences for inflation if unemployment were to run well below the natural rate for an extended period? the flat phillips curve suggests that the implications for inflation might not be large, although a very tight labor market could lead to larger, nonlinear effects. research on this question is ambiguous, again reflecting the limited historical experience.8 we should also remember that where inflation expectations are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept inflation under control. if central banks were instead to try to exploit the nonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization significantly and persistently past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question our commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure. so far, we see no signs of this. if anything, some measures of longer-term inflation expectations in the united states have edged lower in recent years.    third, can persistently strong economic conditions pose financial stability risks? of course, strong economic conditions are a good thing! such conditions can make the financial system better able to absorb shocks through strong balance sheets and investor confidence. but we have often seen confidence become overconfidence and lead to excessive borrowing and risk-taking, leaving the financial system more vulnerable. indeed, the fact that the two most recent u.s. recessions stemmed principally from financial imbalances, not high inflation, highlights the importance of closely monitoring financial conditions. today i see u.s. financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate and broadly in line with their long-run averages. while some asset prices are high by historical standards, i do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage. in addition, banks have far greater levels of capital and liquidity than before the crisis.    fourth, while persistently strong economic conditions can pose risks to inflation and perhaps financial stability, we can also ask whether there may be lasting benefits. as i mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force. in fact, as the labor market has tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off disability rolls.9 there could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth. all told, though, the persistence of any such ""positive hysteresis"" benefits is uncertain, since, again, the historical evidence is sparse and inconclusive.    conclusion    as is often the case, in the current environment, significant uncertainty attends the process of making monetary policy. today, with the economy strong and risks to the outlook balanced, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate remains strong and broadly supported among fomc participants."
2018-08-24,2874.69,"Chair_Powell_2018-Aug-24",0.619885333464009,"thank you for the opportunity to speak here today. fifteen years ago, during the period now referred to as the great moderation, the topic of this symposium was ""adapting to a changing economy."" in opening the proceedings, then-chairman alan greenspan famously declared that ""uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.""1 on the doorstep of the period now referred to as the global financial crisis, surely few, if any, at that symposium would have imagined how shockingly different the next 15 years would be from the 15 years that preceded it.    over the course of a long recovery, the u.s. economy has strengthened substantially. the unemployment rate has declined steadily for almost nine years and, at 3.9 percent, is now near a 20-year low. most people who want jobs can find them. inflation has moved up and is now near the federal open market committee's (fomc) objective of 2 percent after running generally below that level for six years. with solid household and business confidence, healthy levels of job creation, rising incomes, and fiscal stimulus arriving, there is good reason to expect that this strong performance will continue.    as the economy has strengthened, the fomc has gradually raised the federal funds rate from its crisis-era low near zero toward more normal levels. we are also allowing our securities holdings--assets acquired to support the economy during the deep recession and the long recovery--to decline gradually as these securities are paid off. i will explain today why the committee's consensus view is that this gradual process of normalization remains appropriate. as always, there are risk factors abroad and at home that, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today i will step back from these.    in keeping with the spirit of this year's symposium topic--the changing structures of the economy--i would also note briefly that the u.s. economy faces a number of longer-term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary policy. for example, real wages, particularly for medium- and low-income workers, have grown quite slowly in recent decades. economic mobility in the united states has declined and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2 addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. finally, it is difficult to say when or whether the economy will break out of its low-productivity mode of the past decade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise meaningfully over time.    my fomc colleagues and i believe that we can best support progress on these longer-term issues by pursuing the federal reserve's mandate and supporting continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent. the topic of managing uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient. i will focus today on one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium--uncertainty around the location of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of unemployment. a good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the fed:    1. with the unemployment rate well below estimates of its longer-term normal level, why isn't the fomc tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off overheating and inflation?    2. with no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the fomc tightening policy at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion?    these questions strike me as representing the two errors that the committee is always seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating. as i will discuss, the job of avoiding these errors is made challenging today because the economy has been changing in ways that are difficult to detect and measure in real time. i will first lay out a standard view of a handful of basic relationships that are thought to reflect key aspects of the underlying structure of the economy. i will then use that framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy deliberations, focusing on how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.    conventional views of macroeconomic structure  in conventional models of the economy, major economic quantities such as inflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of gross domestic product (gdp) fluctuate around values that are considered ""normal,"" or ""natural,"" or ""desired."" the fomc has chosen a 2 percent inflation objective as one of these desired values. the other values are not directly observed, nor can they be chosen by anyone. instead, these values result from myriad interactions throughout the economy. in the fomc's quarterly summary of economic projections (sep), participants state their individual views on the longer-run normal values for the growth rate of gdp, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate.    these fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more familiar names such as the ""natural rate of unemployment"" and ""potential output growth."" the longer-run federal funds rate minus long-run inflation is the ""neutral real interest rate."" at the fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that they have acquired shorthand names. for example, u* (pronounced ""u star"") is the natural rate of unemployment, r* (""r star"") is the neutral real rate of interest, and π* (""pi star"") is the inflation objective. according to the conventional thinking, policymakers should navigate by these stars.3 in that sense, they are very much akin to celestial stars.    for example, the famous taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based on where inflation and unemployment stand in relation to the stars.4 if inflation is higher than π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r*. the higher real interest rate will, through various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households, which will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off. in contrast, if the unemployment rate is above u*, lower the real federal funds rate relative to r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment.    navigating by the stars can sound straightforward. guiding policy by the stars in practice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the location of the stars have been changing significantly.    shifting stars during normalization  in december 2013, the fomc began winding down the final crisis-era asset purchase program. asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in december 2015, the fomc began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day. as normalization has proceeded, fomc participants and many other private- and public-sector analysts regularly adjusted their assessments of the stars (figure 1). many projections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as did assessments of the neutral interest rate. estimates of the potential growth rate of gdp slipped about 1/2 percentage point.    these changing assessments have big implications. for example, the 1 percentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was considerably closer to its longer-run normal and, hence, that policy was less accommodative than thought at the beginning of normalization. the 1 percentage point fall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million more people would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer-run level. these shifts in the stars generally reflect analysts' attempts to square their estimates with arriving macroeconomic data. for example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then below, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up. when inflation instead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than previously thought. further, over this period, gdp growth was slower than one might have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well-known relationship between output and unemployment known as okun's law. put another way, labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether that shortfall was temporary‑‑perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis--or was part of a new normal.    these assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further revision. to return to the nautical metaphor, the fomc has been navigating between the shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be shifting navigational guides. our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two much discussed historical episodes--the great inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the ""new economy"" period of the late 1990s.    shifting stars and the great inflation  while the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways, the shifting of the stars is not one of them. figure 2 illustrates the congressional budget office's (cbo) current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and potential gdp growth from 1960 to 2000.5 viewed against the ups and downs observed over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer-run values are not all that dramatic. of course, these cbo estimates benefit from many years of hindsight, whereas monetary policy must be based on assessments made in real time. the great inflation period vividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises.    around 1965, the united states entered a period of high and volatile inflation that ended with inflation in double digits in the early 1980s. multiple factors, including monetary policy errors, contributed to the great inflation. many researchers have concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis on imprecise--and, as it turns out, overly optimistic--real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.6    figure 3 compares the cbo's current view of the natural rate of unemployment in that era with an estimate by athanasios orphanides and john williams of the rate as policymakers perceived it in real time. from 1965 to the early 1980s, this real-time estimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it. the unemployment rate over this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary documents reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even further above u* (figure 4, top panel).7 with the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, except for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to inflation's rise (figure 4, lower panel).    it is now clear that the fomc had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations. the great inflation did, however, prompt an ""expectations revolution"" in macroeconomic thinking, with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers: anchoring longer-term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other monetary policy goals.8    when longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, unanticipated developments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return fairly promptly to the desired value. this is the key insight at the heart of the widespread adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the great inflation. anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both unemployment and inflation. when a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank's inflation target. with expectations anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring inflation back down, and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise. thus, policy can be a bit more accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer-term expectations.    shifting stars and the ""new economy"" of the late 1990s  the second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a situation that was in some ways the flipside of that in the great inflation. in mid-1996, the unemployment rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many fomc participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy's potential. sentiment was building on the fomc to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising inflation.9 but chairman greenspan had a hunch that the united states was experiencing the wonders of a ""new economy"" in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks. greenspan argued that the fomc should hold off on rate increases.    over the next two years, thanks to his considerable fortitude, greenspan prevailed, and the fomc raised the federal funds rate only once from mid-1996 through late 1998.10 starting in 1996, the economy boomed and the unemployment rate fell, but, contrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11    once again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many had seen as a puzzle. whereas during the great inflation period the real-time natural rate of unemployment had been well below our current-day assessment, in the new-economy period, this relation was reversed (figure 3). the labor market looked to be tight and getting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor market in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through 1998 (figure 4). greenspan was also right that the potential growth rate had shifted up. with hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth policymakers were forecasting.12    the fomc thus avoided the great-inflation-era mistake of overemphasizing imprecise estimates of the stars. under chairman greenspan's leadership, the committee converged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request: let's wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence tightening.13 meeting after meeting, the committee held off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear. and meeting after meeting, inflation gradually declined.    in retrospect, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend ""let's wait one more meeting,"" given that inflation was low and falling. conventional wisdom at the time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk--even when that risk was gleaned mainly from hazy, real-time assessments of the stars. with the experience in the new-economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller risk that an inflation uptick under greenspan's ""wait and see"" approach would become a significant problem.    risk management in the face of shifting stars  given what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the sort of risk‑management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than ever before. that approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.    experience has revealed two realities about the relation between inflation and unemployment, and these bear directly on the two questions i started with. first, the stars are sometimes far from where we perceive them to be. in particular, we now know that the level of the unemployment rate relative to our real-time estimate of u* will sometimes be a misleading indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation. second, the reverse also seems to be true: inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization. part of the reason inflation sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations and the related flattening of the phillips curve.14 whatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation. thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of excesses.    these two realities present challenges. the literature on uncertainty reviewed at the 2003 symposium--and much refined since then--provides important advice for how policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a prudent central bank should follow.15 the literature on robust rules, such as so-called difference rules, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of unemployment relative to u*.16 the fomc's practice of looking at a broad range of indicators when assessing the state of the labor market has explicitly been part of the fomc's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy since its inception in 2012.17 we have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of labor market tightness and of destabilizing excesses more generally.    the risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the fomc's deliberations. a paper by federal reserve board staff is a recent example of a range of research that helps fomc participants visualize and manage these risks.18 the research reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various policy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy. one general finding is that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a broad range of plausible scenarios.19 more concretely, simulations like these inform our risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse outcomes, such as inflation falling below zero or rising above 5 percent.    finally, the literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights. this literature started with the work of william brainard and the well-known brainard principle, which recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your actions, you should move conservatively.20 in other words, when unsure of the potency of a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose. as brainard made clear, this is not a universal truth, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which doing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much. the first case is when attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended period with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21 in such situations, the famous words ""we will do whatever it takes"" will likely be more effective than ""we will take cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes."" the second case is when inflation expectations threaten to become unanchored. if expectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22 i am confident that the fomc would resolutely ""do whatever it takes"" should inflation expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten. in addition, a decade of regulatory reforms and private-sector advances have greatly increased the strength and resilience of the financial system, with the aim of reducing the likelihood that the inevitable financial shocks will become crises.    the current situation  let me conclude by returning to the matter of navigating between the two risks i identified--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating. readers of the minutes of fomc meetings and other communications will know that our discussions focus keenly on the relative salience of these risks. the diversity of views on the fomc is one of the great virtues of our system. despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a long institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy stance.    i see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the fomc's approach to taking seriously both of these risks. while the unemployment rate is below the committee's estimate of the longer-run natural rate, estimates of this rate are quite uncertain. the same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate. we therefore refer to many indicators when judging the degree of slack in the economy or the degree of accommodation in the current policy stance. we are also aware that, over time, inflation has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization.    while inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear sign of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating. this is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from the ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually closer to the fomc's rough assessment of neutral as the expansion has continued. as the most recent fomc statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate.    the economy is strong. inflation is near our 2 percent objective, and most people who want a job are finding one. my colleagues and i are carefully monitoring incoming data, and we are setting policy to do what monetary policy can do to support continued growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent."
2018-09-27,2914,"Chair_Powell_2018-Sept-27",0.276327697808312,"good afternoon. thank you, senator reed, for the kind words and the opportunity to be a part of the annual rhode island business leaders day. and thank you, all, for sticking with the program for the last speaker of the day. the federal open market committee, the body within the federal reserve that sets monetary policy, just concluded a meeting yesterday. i plan to talk briefly about how my colleagues and i see the economy evolving and our role in keeping it healthy. importantly, i want to hear from you. i very much appreciate your views, as business people, of economic conditions where you live and work. and, of course, i will be happy to respond to questions.    our economy is strong. growth is running at a healthy clip. unemployment is low, the number of people working is rising steadily, and wages are up. inflation is low and stable. all of these developments are very good signs. of course, that is not to say that everything is perfect. the benefits of this strong economy have not reached all americans. many of our country's economic challenges are beyond the scope of the fed, but we are doing all we can to keep the economy strong and moving forward. that is the best way we can promote an environment in which every american has the opportunity to succeed.    each time we meet, we face the same question: how can we set monetary policy to best support job growth and low, steady inflation? for many years, this question called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago. as the economy has steadily gained strength, the fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to the levels that are normal in a healthy economy. we took another step on that path yesterday, with a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. these rates remain low, and my colleagues and i believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benefit of all americans.    as i mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of the financial crisis‑‑a painful part of our history that cost many americans their jobs, their homes, and, for some, their hopes and dreams. in addition to holding interest rates low to support the recovery, we have taken many steps to make the financial system safer. in particular, we are holding the largest banks to much higher standards in the amount of capital and liquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take. i am confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad. we continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also ensuring that regulation is both effective and efficient.    thank you. i am happy to take your questions."
2018-10-02,2923.43,"Chair_Powell_2018-Oct-2",-0.0396636793533558,"it is a pleasure and an honor to speak here today at the 60th annual meeting of the national association for business economics (nabe). since 1959, nabe has promoted the use of economics in the workplace and advanced the worthy purpose of ensuring that leading american businesses benefit from the insights of economists.    today i will focus on the federal reserve's ongoing efforts to promote maximum employment and stable prices. i am pleased to say that, by these measures, the economy looks very good. the unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent, near a 20-year low. inflation is currently running near the federal open market committee's (fomc) objective of 2 percent. while these two top-line statistics do not always present an accurate picture of overall economic conditions, a wide range of data on jobs and prices supports a positive view. in addition, many forecasters are predicting that these favorable conditions are likely to continue. for example, the medians of the most recent projections from fomc participants and the survey of professional forecasters, as well as the most recent congressional budget office (cbo) forecast, all have the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation staying very near 2 percent over the same period.1    from the standpoint of our dual mandate, this is a remarkably positive outlook. indeed, i was asked at last week's press conference whether these forecasts are too good to be true--a reasonable question! since 1950, the u.s. economy has experienced periods of low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such an extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2 standard economic thinking has long offered an explanation for this: if unemployment were to remain this low for this long, employers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising labor costs would feed into more‑rapid price inflation faced by consumers.    this dynamic between unemployment and inflation is known as a phillips curve relationship, and at times it can pose a fundamental tension between the two sides of the fed's mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. recent low inflation and unemployment have some analysts asking, ""is the phillips curve dead?""3 others argue that the phillips curve still lurks in the background and could reemerge at any time to exact revenge for low unemployment in the form of high inflation.    my comments today have two main objectives. the first is to explain how changes in the phillips curve help account for the somewhat surprising but broadly shared current forecasts of continued very low unemployment with inflation near 2 percent. at the risk of spoiling the surprise, i do not see it as likely that the phillips curve is dead, or that it will soon exact revenge. what is more likely, in my view, is that many factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced, but not eliminated, the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation. however, no one fully understands the nature of these changes or the role they play in the current context. common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict events seldom before observed in the economy.4    thus, my second objective today is to explain, given this uncertainty about the unemployment-inflation relationship, the important role that risk management plays in setting monetary policy. i will explore the fomc's monitoring and balancing of risks as well as our contingency planning for cases when risk becomes reality.    historical perspective on jobs and inflation  let us start with a look at the modern history of jobs and inflation in the united states. figure 1 shows headline inflation and unemployment from 1960 to today and extended through 2020 using the average of median projections from both fomc participants and the survey of professional forecasters, and the cbo projections. as the figure makes clear, a multiyear period with unemployment below 4 percent and stable inflation would, if realized, be unique in modern u.s. data.5    to understand the basis for these forecasts, it is useful to contrast two very different periods included in figure 1: from 1960 to 1985, and the period from 1995 to today. the first period includes the great inflation, and the latter includes both the great moderation and the distinctly immoderate period of the global financial crisis and its aftermath.    figure 2 shows unemployment and core, rather than headline, inflation in these two periods. while our inflation objective concerns headline inflation, switching to core inflation makes some relationships clearer by removing a good deal of variability due to food and energy prices, variability that is not primarily driven by labor market conditions or monetary policy.    there is a dramatic difference in the unemployment-inflation relationship across these two periods. during the great inflation, unemployment fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, and inflation moved over a similar range. in the recent period, the unemployment rate also fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, but inflation has been relatively tame, averaging 1.7 percent and never declining below 1 percent or rising to 2.5 percent. even during the financial crisis, core inflation barely budged. as a thought experiment, look at the right panel and imagine that you could see only the red line (inflation), and not the blue line (unemployment). nothing in the red line hints at a major economic event, let alone the immense upheaval around the time of the global financial crisis.    notice that, in each period, there is only one episode in which unemployment drops below 4 percent. in the late 1960s, unemployment remained at or below 4 percent for four years, and during that time inflation rose steadily from under 2 percent to almost 5 percent. by contrast, the late 1990s episode of below-4-percent unemployment was quite brief, and during the episode and surrounding quarters inflation was reasonably stable and remained below 2 percent.    to explore the phillips curve relationship in these two periods more closely, we need to bring in the concept of the natural rate of unemployment. in standard economic thinking, an unemployment rate above the natural rate indicates slack in the labor market and tends to be associated with downward pressure on inflation; unemployment below the natural rate represents a tight labor market and is associated with upward inflation pressure.    figure 3 repeats figure 2 but replaces unemployment with labor market slack as measured by unemployment minus the cbo's current estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at each point in time.6 periods of tight labor markets are shaded. during the great inflation, inflation generally rose in the tight, shaded periods and fell in the unshaded ones, just as conventional phillips curve reasoning predicts.    from 1995 to today, the large and persistent swings in the gap between unemployment and the natural rate were associated with, at most, a move of a few tenths in the inflation rate. comparing the shaded and unshaded regions, you might see some association between slack and the minor ups and downs in inflation, but the pattern is not at all consistent. it is evidence like this that fuels speculation about the phillips curve's demise.    whether dead, sick, or merely resting, many of the questions about the phillips curve come down to figuring out what changed between these two periods, and why. let us turn to a conceptual framework for examining these questions more systematically.    a simple framework for understanding changes in the jobs-inflation relationship  a natural starting point is the simplest form of a phillips curve equation, which posits that inflation this year is determined by some combination of current labor market slack, inflation last year, and some other factors that i will leave aside for this discussion (figure 4):7    inflation(t)=−bslack(t)+cinflation(t−1)+other(t)  the value of b is often referred to as the slope of the phillips curve. with a larger value of b, any change in labor market slack translates into a bigger change in inflation. as we say, as b increases, the phillips curve steepens. the value of c determines inflation's persistence--that is, how long any given change in inflation tends to linger. as the value of c increases, higher inflation this year translates more into higher inflation next year. a particularly nasty case arises when b and c are both large. in this case, slack has a large effect on inflation, and that effect tends to be very persistent. one implication of a large c is that, if a boom drives inflation up, it will tend to stay up unless offset by a subsequent bust.8    figure 5 shows regression estimates of b and c, computed over 20-year samples starting with the sample from 1965 to 1984 and including each 20-year sample through 2017. during the great inflation samples, the value of c is near 1, meaning that higher inflation one year tended to translate almost one-for-one into higher inflation the next. the phillips curve is also relatively steep in the great inflation samples, with 1 extra percentage point of lower unemployment converting into roughly 1/2 percentage point of higher inflation. thus, the great inflation presented that nasty case just described.    fortunately, things changed. the estimates of both b and c fall in value as the estimation sample shifts forward in time. in the most recent samples, the phillips curve is nearly flat, with b very near zero, and c is about 0.25, meaning that roughly one fourth of any rise or fall in inflation carries forward. these results give numerical form to what we see in the right-hand panel of figure 3, covering the recent period: large and persistent moves in the unemployment gap were associated with, at most, modest transitory moves in inflation.    what led to the changes in the phillips curve?  these developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation. to provide a sound basis for monetary policy, it is important to understand what happened and why, so we can avoid a return to the bad old days of the 1970s. like many, i believe better monetary policy has played a central role.9    to understand the mechanism, let us ask how central banks could, presumably inadvertently, amplify and extend the duration of inflation's response to labor market tightness. to do so, the central bank could persistently ease the stance of monetary policy in response to an uptick in inflation. no responsible central banker today would intentionally do this, but much research suggests that during the great inflation, misunderstandings about how the economy worked led the fed effectively to behave in this manner.10 some policymakers may have believed the misguided notion that accommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher employment.11 other policymakers misperceived the level of the natural rate of unemployment, which we now believe had shifted up markedly in the 1960s. with the higher natural rate, the labor market was much tighter and provided much greater upward pressure on inflation than policymakers realized in real time. as a result, they were continually ""behind the curve.""12    the channel through which monetary policy can amplify and extend inflation's response to shocks becomes even stronger when we take account of expectations. if people come to expect that upward blips in inflation will result in ongoing higher inflation, they will build that view into wage and price decisions. in this case, people's expectations become a force adding momentum to inflation, and breaking inflation's momentum can require convincing people to change their minds and behavior--never an easy task. arguably, this is why a federal funds rate near 20 percent--roughly 10 percent in real terms‑‑was required in the early 1980s to turn the tide on high inflation. the cost, in the form of very high unemployment, is clear in the great inflation figures. the great inflation taught us that a main task of monetary policy is to keep inflation expectations anchored at some low level.    this idea is behind the adoption in recent decades of inflation targets, such as the fed's 2 percent objective, by central banks around the world. when monetary policy tends to offset shocks to inflation, rather than amplifying and extending them, and when people come to expect this policy response, a surprise rise or fall in labor market tightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation. research suggests that this reasoning can account for a good deal of the change in the phillips curve relationship.13 it is also likely that many other factors have contributed to changes in inflation dynamics over recent decades. we do not fully understand the causes and implications of these changes, which raises risk management issues that i will take up now.14    a favorable outlook, but what could go wrong?  to set the stage, let us return to the situation facing the fomc. the baseline forecasts of most fomc participants and a broad range of others show unemployment remaining below 4 percent for an extended period, with inflation steady near 2 percent. i have made the case that this forecast is not too good to be true and does not signal the death of the phillips curve. instead, the outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat phillips curve and inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent.    but we still must face the cautionary advice to beware when forecasts point to rarely seen outcomes. as a way of heeding this advice, the committee takes a risk management approach, which has three important parts: monitoring risks; balancing risks, both upside and downside; and contingency planning for surprises. let me describe a few of the risks and how we are thinking about them.    could inflation expectations become unanchored?  first is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor. we attribute a great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations. and we are aware that it could be very costly if those expectations were to drift materially. as you probably know from our public communications, we carefully monitor survey- and market-based proxies for expectations, and we do not see evidence of a material shift in longer-term expectations (figure 6). the survey measures have been particularly steady for some time.15 the financial market-based measures include both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component, so they tend to move around much more than the surveys, but we see no evidence of a material change in these measures, either.    the risks to inflation expectations are, of course, two sided. until this summer, inflation had remained stubbornly below 2 percent for several years. and major economies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with disinflationary forces. thus, we have been and will remain alert for possible downward drift in expectations. some argue the contrary case--that by only gradually removing accommodation as the unemployment rate has fallen, the fomc may have fallen behind the curve, thereby risking an upward drift in expectations. from the standpoint of contingency planning, our course is clear: resolutely conduct policy consistent with the fomc's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and stand ready to act with authority if expectations drift materially up or down.    could inflation pressures move up more than expected in a hot economy?  a second risk is that labor market tightness or tightness in other parts of the production chain might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected--the ""revenge of the phillips curve"" scenario.16 as i mentioned, the fomc carefully monitors a wide array of early indicators of inflation pressure to evaluate this risk. wages and compensation data are one important source of information. these measures have picked up some recently, but in a way that is quite welcome. specifically, the rise in wages is broadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth and therefore does not point to an overheating labor market. further, higher wage growth alone need not be inflationary. the late 1990s episode of low unemployment saw wages rise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation.    despite what shows up in the aggregate wage and compensation data, however, i am sure that, like us, many of you are hearing widespread anecdotes about labor shortages and increasing bottlenecks in production. for example, as shown in figure 7, the words ""shortage"" and ""bottleneck"" are increasingly appearing in the beige book, the federal reserve's report summarizing discussions with our business contacts around the country.17 the message we are hearing in our conversations is supported by a wide range of more conventional measures. for example, the survey of members of the national federation of independent business finds firms increasingly reporting that job openings are hard to fill (figure 8). further, these businesses now list ""quality of labor"" as their most important problem, as opposed to the more typical report of ""poor sales.""    we review a wide variety of measures of this type, and these indicators show what i think most business people see: an economy operating with limited slack. notice, however, that these measures are near levels that prevailed in the late 1990s or early 2000s, a period when core inflation remained under 2 percent.    while the late 1990s case proves that elevated values of these tightness measures do not automatically translate into rising inflation, a single episode provides only limited reassurance. thus, the fomc takes seriously the possibility that tight markets for labor or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline outlook. our best estimates, however, suggest that so long as inflation expectations remain anchored, a modest steepening of the phillips curve would be unlikely to cause a significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18 once again, the key is the anchored expectations.    is the natural rate of unemployment lower than expected?  a third risk--in this case an upside risk--is that the natural rate of unemployment could be even lower than current estimates. some have argued that the fed should be removing policy accommodation much more slowly, pushing the economy to see if the natural rate of unemployment is lower still.    advocates of this view note that over the past several years of policy normalization, the economy has continued to strengthen and unemployment has fallen, but inflation has remained quiet. as i discussed in a recent speech, many analysts have accounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural rate.19 for example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from four well-known sources have fallen over that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent (figure 9).    if the natural rate is now materially lower than we believe, that would imply less upward pressure on inflation--the flip side of the ""revenge of the phillips curve"" risk. our policy of gradual interest rate normalization represents the fomc's attempt to take both of these risks seriously. removing accommodation too quickly could needlessly foreshorten the expansion. moving too slowly could risk rising inflation and inflation expectations. our path of gradually removing accommodation, while closely monitoring the economy, is designed to balance these risks.    in wrapping up this discussion of risks to the favorable outlook, i should emphasize that i have chosen to focus on three risks that are all associated with the phillips curve. there are, of course, myriad other risks. to name just a few, we must consider the strength of economies abroad, the effects of ongoing trade disputes, and financial stability issues. i hope my discussion of three particular risks gives a sense of how we approach these issues.    conclusion  many of us have been looking back recently on the decade that has passed since the depths of the financial crisis. in light of that experience, i am glad to be able to stand here and say that the economy is strong, unemployment is near 50-year lows, and inflation is roughly at our 2 percent objective. the baseline outlook of forecasters inside and outside the fed is for more of the same.    this historically rare pairing of steady, low inflation and very low unemployment is testament to the fact that we remain in extraordinary times. our ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that come with extraordinary times, so as to extend the current expansion, while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation."
2018-11-28,2743.79,"Chair_Powell_2018-Nov-28",2.29739352837441,"it is a pleasure to be back at the economic club of new york. i will begin by briefly reviewing the outlook for the economy, and then turn to a discussion of financial stability. my main subject today will be the profound transformation since the global financial crisis in the federal reserve's approach to monitoring and addressing financial stability. today marks the publication of the board of governors' first financial stability report. earlier this month, we published our first supervision and regulation report. together, these reports contain a wealth of information on our approach to financial stability and to financial regulation more broadly. by clearly and transparently explaining our policies, we aim to strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy that enables the fed to serve the needs of the american public.    outlook and monetary policy  congress assigned the federal reserve the job of promoting maximum employment and price stability. i am pleased to say that our economy is now close to both of those objectives. the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a 49-year low, and many other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests. inflation is near our 2 percent target. the economy is growing at an annual rate of about 3 percent, well above most estimates of its longer-run trend.    for seven years during the crisis and its painful aftermath, the federal open market committee (fomc) kept our policy interest rate unprecedentedly low--in fact, near zero--to support the economy as it struggled to recover. the health of the economy gradually but steadily improved, and about three years ago the fomc judged that the interests of households and businesses, of savers and borrowers, were no longer best served by such extraordinarily low rates. we therefore began to raise our policy rate gradually toward levels that are more normal in a healthy economy. interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy‑‑that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth. my fomc colleagues and i, as well as many private-sector economists, are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation near 2 percent.    there is a great deal to like about this outlook. but we know that things often turn out to be quite different from even the most careful forecasts. for this reason, sound policymaking is as much about managing risks as it is about responding to the baseline forecast. our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing risks. we know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion. we also know that moving too slowly--keeping interest rates too low for too long--could risk other distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances. our path of gradual increases has been designed to balance these two risks, both of which we must take seriously.    we also know that the economic effects of our gradual rate increases are uncertain, and may take a year or more to be fully realized. while fomc participants' projections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy path. we will be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and financial data are telling us. as always, our decisions on monetary policy will be designed to keep the economy on track in light of the changing outlook for jobs and inflation.    under the dual mandate, jobs and inflation are the fed's meat and potatoes. in the rest of my comments, i will focus on financial stability--a topic that has always been on the menu, but that, since the crisis, has become a more integral part of the meal.    historical perspective on financial stability  the term ""financial stability"" has a particular meaning in this context. a stable financial system is one that continues to function effectively even in severely adverse conditions. a stable system meets the borrowing and investment needs of households and businesses despite economic turbulence. an unstable system, in contrast, may amplify turbulence and prolong economic hardship in the face of stress by failing to provide these essential services when they are needed most.    for economic club of new york trivia buffs, i will note that the second ever presentation to this club by a federal reserve official was about this very topic. the date was march 18, 1929. weeks before, the fed had issued a public statement of concern over stock market speculation, and had provided guidance frowning on bank funding of such speculation. william harding, a former fed chair and then president of the federal reserve bank of boston, defended the fed's actions in his talk. he argued that, while the fed should not act as the arbiter of correct asset prices, it did have a primary responsibility to protect the banking system's capacity to meet the credit needs of households and businesses. at the meeting, critics argued that public statements about inflated asset prices were ""fraught with danger;"" that the nation's banks were so well managed that they should not ""face public admonition""; and, more generally, that the fed was ""out of its sphere.""1 of course, harding spoke just a few months before the 1929 stock market crash, which signaled the onset of the great depression.2    fast forwarding, a host of depression-era reforms helped avoid, for the next three-quarters of a century, a systemic financial crisis and the associated severe economic dislocation‑‑the longest such period in american history. those decades saw many advances in monetary policy and in bank regulatory policy, but the appropriate role for government in managing threats to the broader financial system remained unresolved. periodic bouts of financial stress during this period--such as the latin american debt crisis, the savings and loan crisis, and the russian debt default--were met with improvised responses. policymakers conjured fixes from a mixture of private-sector rescues, emergency liquidity, occasional implicit or explicit bailouts, and monetary accommodation. outside of these crisis responses, however, systemic issues were not a central focus of policy.    the global financial crisis demonstrated, in the clearest way, the limits of this approach. highly inventive and courageous improvisation amid scenes of great drama helped avoid another great depression, but failed to prevent the most severe recession in 75 years. the crisis made clear that there can be no macroeconomic stability without financial stability, and that systemic stability risks often take root and blossom in good times.3 thus, as the emergency phase of the crisis subsided, congress, the fed, and the other financial regulators began developing a fundamentally different approach to financial stability. instead of relying on improvised responses after crises strike, policymakers now constantly monitor vulnerabilities and require firms to plan in advance for financial distress, in a framework that lays out solutions in advance during good times.    the new approach to financial stability  this new approach can be divided into three parts. first, build up the strength and resilience of the financial system. second, develop and apply a broad framework for monitoring financial stability on an ongoing basis. and third, explain the new approach as transparently as possible, so that the public and its representatives in congress can provide oversight and hold us accountable for this work. although i'll focus mainly on the stability efforts of the federal reserve, a number of federal regulatory agencies have responsibilities in this area. all of these agencies are represented on the financial stability oversight council, or fsoc, which is chaired by the treasury secretary and which provides a forum for interagency cooperation in responding to emerging risks.    building resilience of the financial system  after 10 years of concentrated effort in the public and private sectors, the system is now much stronger, with greater capacity to function effectively in stressful times. in the banking system, we have implemented a post-crisis regulatory framework based on robust capital and liquidity requirements, a strong stress-testing regime, and mandatory living wills for the largest firms. as a result, banks now have much more high quality capital than before (figure 1). the most recent stress tests indicate that, even after a severe global recession, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above regulatory minimums, and above the levels those banks held in good times before the crisis.4 the most systemically important financial institutions also now hold roughly 20 percent of their assets in the form of high quality liquid assets--that is, safe assets that could be readily sold at short notice (figure 2). the share of these assets is about four times its pre-crisis level.    compared with other economies, lending and borrowing in the united states depend less on bank loans and more on funds flowing through a wide array of capital market channels. the crisis revealed that this capital market centric system, despite its many benefits, also provides more places where systemic risks can emerge. in response, congress and the regulatory agencies have made many stability-enhancing changes outside of the banking system. for example, many derivatives transactions are now required to be centrally cleared, which, through netting, has reduced exposures and enabled better management of counterparty risk. tri-party repurchase agreement (repo) reforms have substantially improved the resilience of that marketplace, in particular by limiting intraday loans. before the crisis, prime institutional money market funds were permitted to report a constant, $1 share price so long as the value of the underlying assets remained near $1. this reporting convention, combined with the implicit support of the plans' sponsors, led investors to treat those funds like bank deposits, even though they were not likewise insured. these funds are now required to report floating net-asset values, and after this reform investors chose to migrate to government-only funds, which are safer and less susceptible to runs (figure 3).5 these and other measures have reduced the risk that key non-bank parts of the system would freeze up in the face of market stress.    a new framework for monitoring systemic risks  innovation and risk-taking contribute to the dynamism of our financial system and our economy. as hyman minsky emphasized, along with the many benefits of dynamism comes the reality that the financial system will sometimes evolve toward excess and dangerous imbalances.6 this reality underscores the vital importance of the second part of post-crisis reform: monitoring for emerging vulnerabilities.    as laid out in our new financial stability report, we have developed a framework to help us monitor risks to stability in our complex and rapidly evolving financial system. the framework distinguishes between shocks, that is, trigger events that can be hard to predict or influence, and vulnerabilities, defined as features of the financial system that amplify shocks. the report is organized around four broad vulnerabilities that have been prominent in financial crises through the centuries. each of these vulnerabilities is often found to some degree even in healthy market-based systems, and there is not, at present, any generally accepted standard for assessing at what level the vulnerabilities begin to pose serious stability risks. in lieu of such a standard, we flag cases in which the vulnerabilities rise well beyond historical norms, and then form judgments about the stability risks those cases present.    the first vulnerability is excessive leverage in the financial sector.7 if a highly leveraged segment of the financial system is buffeted by adverse events, the affected entities may all need to deleverage at the same time by selling assets, leading to what is called a ""fire sale."" both the resulting decline in asset prices and the impaired ability of the segment to play its role in the economy can amplify the effects of a downturn. we saw this chain of events play out repeatedly in various parts of the financial sector in the weeks following the failure of lehman brothers in 2008.    in our surveillance, we examine leverage across many types of financial institutions, including banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and various funding vehicles. currently, we do not detect a broad-based buildup of abnormal or excessive leverage. as with banks, capital levels at insurance companies and broker-dealers appear robust. in addition, securitization levels are far below their pre-crisis levels, and those structures that do exist rely on more stable funding (see figure 4). our view into leverage and risk-taking outside the banking sector is admittedly incomplete, however, and we are always working to get a better view of emerging leverage excesses.8    the second vulnerability is funding risk, which arises when banks or nonbank financial entities rely on funding that can be rapidly withdrawn. if depositors or market participants lose faith in the soundness of an institution or the system as a whole, unstable funding can simply vanish in what is called a ""run."" during the crisis, we saw widespread runs, including at broker-dealers, some segments of the repo market, and money market mutual funds. these runs did severe damage, contributing to a generalized panic at the time. had the authorities not stepped in, the damage could have been even more severe.    today we view funding-risk vulnerabilities as low. banks hold low levels of liabilities that are able and likely to run, and they hold high levels of liquid assets to fund any outflows that do occur. money market mutual fund reforms have greatly reduced the run risk in that sector. more generally, it is short-term, uninsured funding that would be most likely to run in a future stress event, and the volume of such funding is now significantly below pre-crisis peaks.    taken together, the evidence on these first two vulnerabilities strongly supports the view that financial institutions and markets are substantially more resilient than they were before the crisis. indeed, the american financial system has successfully weathered some periods of significant stress over the past several years.9    the third vulnerability is excessive debt loads at households and businesses. credit booms have often led to credit busts and sometimes to painful economic downturns. when the bust comes, those who have overborrowed tend to sharply reduce their spending. defaults typically rise faster than had been expected, which may put financial institutions into distress. these effects may combine to bring a serious economic downturn.    this boom-bust pattern was clear in measures of household debt around the crisis period, with mortgage debt rising far above its historical trend and then contracting sharply (see figure 5). after the contraction, household debt has grown only moderately. the net increase in mortgage debt has been among borrowers with higher credit scores. while heavily indebted households always suffer in a downturn, all of this suggests that household debt would not present a systemic stability threat if the economy sours.    nonfinancial business borrowing presents a subtler story. with corporate debt, the united states has not faced a massive credit boom like that experienced with residential mortgages before the recent crisis. instead, after controlling for its trend, business borrowing relative gdp has risen during expansions, no doubt reflecting business optimism, and then fallen when the cycle turned, as some of that optimism proved unfounded (see figure 6). by this measure, the ratio of corporate debt to gdp is about where one might expect after nearly a decade of economic expansion: it is well above its trend, but not yet at the peaks hit in the late 1980s or late 1990s. further, the upward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business assets relative to gdp.    there are reasons for concern, however. information on individual firms reveals that, over the past year, firms with high leverage and interest burdens have been increasing their debt loads the most (see figure 7). in addition, other measures of underwriting quality have deteriorated, and leverage multiples have moved up. some of these highly leveraged borrowers would surely face distress if the economy turned down, leading investors to take higher-than-expected losses--developments that could exacerbate the downturn. the question for financial stability is whether elevated business bankruptcies and outsized losses would risk undermining the ability of the financial system to perform its critical functions on behalf of households and businesses. for now, my view is that such losses are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institutions at the core of the system and, instead, are likely to fall on investors in vehicles like collateralized loan obligations with stable funding that present little threat of damaging fire sales.10 of course, we will continue to monitor developments in this sector carefully.    the fourth and final vulnerability arises when asset values rise far above conventional, historically observed valuation benchmarks--a phenomenon popularly referred to as a ""bubble."" the contentious term ""bubble"" does not appear in our work, however.11 instead, we focus is on the extent to which an asset's price is high or low relative to conventional benchmarks based on expected payoffs and current economic conditions. historically, when asset prices soar far above standard benchmarks, sharp declines follow with some regularity, and those declines may bring economic misery reaching far beyond investors directly involved in the speculative boom. we therefore pay close attention when valuations get to the extreme ends of what we have seen in history.    looking across the landscape of major asset classes, we see some classes for which valuations seem high relative to history. for example, even after standard adjustments for economic conditions, valuations on riskier forms of corporate debt and commercial properties are in the upper ends of their post-crisis distributions, although they are short of the levels they hit in the pre-crisis credit boom. we see no major asset class, however, where valuations appear far in excess of standard benchmarks as some did, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom.    the asset class that gets the most attention day-to-day is, of course, the stock market. today, equity market prices are broadly consistent with historical benchmarks such as forward price-to-earnings ratios (see figure 8). it is important to distinguish between market volatility and events that threaten financial stability. large, sustained declines in equity prices can put downward pressure on spending and confidence. from the financial stability perspective, however, today we do not see dangerous excesses in the stock market.    monitoring likely triggers for financial distress  i mentioned the distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks, or triggers. in addition to monitoring vulnerabilities under our four-part framework, we also consult a broad range of contacts regarding sources of risk that might trigger distress at any given time. for example, discussions with contacts currently point to risks emanating from the normalization of monetary policy in the united states and elsewhere, the unsettled state of trade negotiations, brexit negotiations, budget discussions between italy and the european union, and cyber-related disruptions.12    having identified possible triggers, we can assess how a particular trigger is likely to interact with known vulnerabilities. a good current example is that of brexit. u.s. banks and broker-dealers participate in some of the markets most likely to be affected by brexit. the fed and other regulators have been working with u.s. financial institutions that have operations in the european union or the united kingdom to prepare for the full range of possible outcomes to the negotiations. in addition, the scenarios used in the stress tests routinely feature severe global contractions and show that u.s. banks have the capital to weather even highly disruptive events.    bottom line: financial stability risks are moderate  i have reviewed a few of the key facts that inform our thinking about financial stability, and you will find a great deal more detail in our new report. you will also find that the report does not come to a bottom line conclusion. as i noted earlier, we have limited experience with this monitoring, and there is no widely accepted basis for reaching a bottom line. thus, the purpose of the report is to provide a common platform and set of readings from which policymakers and other interested parties can form their own views. individual policymakers will sometimes differ in their assessments and on the relative weight they put on particular vulnerabilities. my own assessment is that, while risks are above normal in some areas and below normal in others, overall financial stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level.13    in my view, the most important feature of the stability landscape is the strength of the financial system. the risks of destabilizing runs are far lower than in the past. the institutions at the heart of the financial system are more resilient. the stress tests routinely feature extremely severe downturns in business credit, and the largest banks have the capital and liquidity to continue to function under such circumstances. because this core resilience is so important, we are committed to preserving and strengthening the key improvements since the crisis, particularly those in capital, liquidity, stress testing, and resolution.    conclusion  i'd like to conclude by putting financial stability and our two new reports in a longer-term context. to paraphrase a famous line, ""eternal vigilance is the price of financial stability."" we will publish these reports regularly as part of our vigilance.    over time, some may be tempted to dismiss the reports entirely or to overdramatize any concerns they raise. instead, these reports should be viewed as you might view the results of a regular health checkup. we all hope for a report that is not very exciting. many baby boomers like me are, however, reaching an age where a good report is, ""well, there are a number of things we should keep an eye on, but all things considered you are in good health."" that is how i view the financial stability report out today.    we hope that this report and the supervision and regulation report will be important tools, sharing federal reserve views and stimulating public dialogue regarding the stability of the financial system."
2018-12-03,2790.37,"Chair_Powell_2018-Dec-3",1.09413550614635,"thank you, anna. it's an honor to be part of this important occasion. tonight is an opportunity to recognize the vital contributions of the federal reserve's community development staff, and an opportunity to honor chair yellen, who did so much to advance the fed's community development mission.    briefly, i would like to focus on the importance of promoting a strong economy that extends opportunity to all and on the role our community development staff plays to advance that goal.    the federal reserve's mission is to promote a strong economy and sound financial system; i am glad to say we have made a great deal of progress toward those goals. unemployment is 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century. over 17 million jobs have been created during this expansion, with an additional 250,000 created in october.    beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength. the steady decline in the unemployment rate is mirrored by the decline in financial hardship reported by respondents to the federal reserve's survey of household economics and decisionmaking over the past five years.1 wage gains, increased household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence are supporting robust consumer spending. since the crisis, we have also taken numerous steps to make the financial system safer and stronger, leaving it better equipped to support the financial needs of consumers and communities through good times and bad.2    however, the benefits of this strong economy and sound financial system have not reached all americans. the aggregate statistics tend to mask important disparities by income, race, and geography.    moreover, the economy faces a number of longer-term challenges.3 while there have been gains in the pace of wage growth recently, wages for lower-income workers have grown quite slowly over the past few decades. productivity has picked up in recent months after several years of very slow growth, but it is not clear whether this is a trend that will be sustained. an aging population is limiting growth in labor supply, which in turn limits potential growth. and a decades-long decline in economic mobility in the united states reflects the difficulty faced by lower-income americans in moving up the economic ladder.4    the fed's community development function plays a key role in helping us carry out our broad responsibilities. information gathered by the community development staff ensures that the perspectives of individuals and communities inform the fed's research, policy, and actions. soliciting diverse views on issues affecting the economy and financial markets improves the quality of our research, the fairness of our policies, and the transparency of our actions. raising awareness of emerging economic trends and risks makes regulation and supervision more responsive to evolving consumer financial services markets and technologies. the fed's community development function also advances our community reinvestment act responsibilities by analyzing and disseminating information related to local financial needs and successful approaches for attracting and deploying capital. these efforts strengthen the capacity of both financial institutions and community organizations to meet the needs of the communities they serve.    in addition to providing us with a richer, more nuanced understanding of current economic and financial conditions, the federal reserve's community development staff is deeply engaged in helping lower-income and underserved communities overcome their challenges and capitalize on their assets. one thing that was apparent during the recession and the uneven recovery that followed was that people and the places they live are linked. when one struggles, both struggle. successful community development invests in and builds up both the physical infrastructure and human capital in underserved areas. the federal reserve is uniquely positioned to bring together diverse stakeholders to disseminate information, exchange ideas, and identify shared interests that foster local partnerships and comprehensive solutions.    this event is an opportunity to recognize your efforts to advance solutions that build resilient and more prosperous communities. i want to thank ariel cisneros--our distinguished inaugural recipient of the yellen award for excellence in community development--as well as each of you for your individual and collective service to this effort.    and speaking of service: it is fitting that this award for excellence in community development will today and thenceforth be given in honor of janet yellen. during your tenure as chair, janet, you elevated the importance of economic and financial inclusion and the fed's role in community development. you reminded us that an inclusive economy is a vibrant economy. governor brainard, the principal oversight governor for community development, and i are honored to carry this message forward. the economy benefits when we successfully tap into the underutilized potential of more of our fellow americans.5    thank you, janet, for everything that you accomplished as chair and over a lifetime of public service that thankfully continues today. and congratulations, ariel, for what you have accomplished in service to others, which has made you such a deserving recipient of this award."
2018-12-06,2695.95,"Chair_Powell_2018-Dec-6",-0.152218839581347,"thank you for the kind introduction, and thank you to the housing assistance council (hac) for inviting me to be part of this discussion of rural housing. i understand that you will shortly be presenting awards to people who are working at the local and national levels and in both the public and private sectors and whose efforts have improved housing conditions for the rural poor. all of you who work in these roles are doing your country a great service by helping to advance economic opportunity in our communities. i want to thank the award recipients for the difference you make in the lives of people in rural communities.    i am happy to report that our economy is currently performing very well overall, with strong job creation and gradually rising wages. the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969. a strong job market has encouraged more people to participate in the labor market, another positive development. in fact, by many national-level measures, our labor market is very strong.    as those at this conference are acutely aware, however, aggregate statistics can mask important variations between different demographic and income groups, as well as significant regional differences. for example, unemployment rates in some persistently poor rural counties remain much higher than the national figures. the annual average unemployment rate in 2017 exceeded 10 percent in 27 persistently poor rural counties, and the rate was 20 percent or more in 2 of those counties. recent fed research found that, since 2007, labor force participation rates for those in their prime working years in rural areas have increasingly lagged rates in urban areas. labor force participation has been particularly low for those with only a high school diploma or less.1 research has also found that business formation and employment growth during the recovery have been concentrated in large urban areas.2 data and research findings like these remind us that, despite positive trends in national data, the benefits of the ongoing economic expansion are still not reaching some communities.    through the fed's 12 reserve banks and their branches, we are able to get a clearer picture of conditions in individual communities across the nation. each of the reserve banks has an active, well-staffed community development function--one of the great benefits of the federal reserve's structure. we get important and timely information on the state of local economic and financial conditions, including those affecting low- and moderate-income, as well as other underserved, communities.    our community development staff provide us with a more nuanced understanding of current economic and financial conditions. they also help people in low-income and underserved communities overcome the challenges they face. we support numerous initiatives in rural communities across the country, several of which i would like to highlight.    the first initiative is the federal reserve bank of st. louis's longtime commitment to the mississippi and arkansas delta region. this region has struggled for decades with persistent intergenerational poverty and a lack of resources and capacity to address this challenge. most recently, in 2016 the st. louis fed launched the delta communities initiative, and since then it has held 26 regional forums with more than 500 participants. these forums help to build awareness of promising tools and strategies for community and economic development. a recent survey of participants suggests that these forums are making a real difference.    a second example is the federal reserve bank of dallas's commitment to advancing digital inclusion in low-income rural communities. despite significant effort and advances made by public, private, and nonprofit organizations in recent years, nearly 30 percent of rural households continue to lack access to broadband internet service. also, fewer than half of households earning less than $20,000 per year have such service.3 in an increasingly digital economy, lack of access to high-speed internet and the knowledge of how to make the best use of it limits the ability of families and entire communities to reach their full potential. to address this problem, the dallas fed has explored the role of the community reinvestment act (cra) in addressing the digital divide, the potential for technology to bridge the urban-rural divide in access to health care, and the critical importance of preparing workers for the digital economy.4    third and last, community development staff at the federal reserve board and several reserve banks have conducted research to better understand housing affordability challenges affecting rural communities nationwide, recognizing the importance of sufficient affordable housing to a community's economic vitality. researchers found that, as in many urban areas nationwide, a large portion of renters in rural communities struggle to afford their rent‑‑a finding that will not come as a surprise in this room. fortunately, our staff also highlighted promising policy and practice solutions that have been implemented in some communities to try to address these challenges, including the establishment of dedicated funding for affordable housing and the elimination of exclusionary land use and zoning policies.5    while this type of research and community engagement work is a central component of our efforts to support rural areas, we also know that communities need resources and dedicated local partners to help implement many of the strategies involved. cra has been an important tool for strengthening local community and economic development infrastructure since it was enacted in 1977. we also recognize that significant changes in the financial services industry since then have hindered the law's effectiveness, especially in rural communities, and that an update of the implementing regulations is appropriate. as my colleague governor brainard has noted, one of the principles guiding our cra modernization work is that any redesign of cra regulations should continue to encourage banks to seek opportunities in underserved areas, including rural communities.    i understand that the hac has done considerable research and stakeholder engagement to shed light on the barriers to the effective use of cra in rural communities; all of that work will benefit our reform efforts. the fed's ongoing series of roundtable discussions in communities across the country will also allow us to hear suggestions for improving cra from local stakeholders, including many people from rural communities. these perspectives will inform our deliberations on this critical regulation, and we will make a summary of our discussions available to the public.    in closing, while the economy is strong overall, we recognize that some communities have yet to feel the full benefits of the ongoing expansion. we are conducting research, collaborating with communities, and assessing financial regulations so that our nation's current prosperity will benefit small towns and cities alike. the work being done by tonight's award recipients and by each of you in this room is critical to making progress toward that goal. thank you for being our partners in this work, and enjoy the conference.

2019-02-06,2731.61,"Chair_Powell_2019-Feb-6",-0.222449501406279,"thank you to all the educators who are here with us in washington or are joining us online. i look forward to responding to your questions. but first, i have a few thoughts about the vital work you do as economics educators and its connection to what the federal reserve is trying to accomplish. i promise to be brief, because it is a school night.    i am here today, and the fed has organized this event, because of the importance of economics education. some of your students may go on to become professional economists, but all of them, i hope, will apply the valuable lessons and the skills they have gained from economics in other careers and in others aspects of their lives.    studying economics can benefit students in multiple ways. the lessons of economics are valuable in a wide variety of vocations. moreover, the knowledge gained will empower students as consumers, managers of their own finances, and as informed citizens. economics has been consistently useful to me over my career in law, finance, and government service. it is, of course, central to my current role as a monetary policymaker and financial regulator.    in government, economic analysis is one of the principal tools we use in making policy decisions. among other things, economics is an essential facet of the science of public policy. what policies actually work? which ones sound good but don't work, or are actually counter-productive? economics gives us the tools to answer those questions and help us make the best the decisions on behalf of the public.    of course, economics is not only the basis for judgments and decisions made by the fed and other government agencies. it also underpins the countless decisions by consumers, businesses, and investors that drive economic activity. the concepts you teach and apply in the classroom guide those decisions and even help explain human behavior outside of the workings of the economy. for example, to continue to grow and succeed, any business owner should understand the differences between fixed cost, variable cost, average cost, and marginal cost. businesses and investors need to understand present or discounted value, but so should any parent or grandparent starting a college fund. economics teaches us about the power of incentives, which are central to thinking about and understanding regulatory and tax policy. but incentives also help motivate people in a variety of other settings, such as encouraging students to do their best in school, helping reduce traffic jams, or even nudging someone to save more or to exercise regularly. economics is a practical and powerful tool for understanding how we relate to each other.    and that's why what you do for your students is so important. like all teachers, you are helping prepare them for success in life. the knowledge you impart and the intellect and talents you help develop are tools that your students can use to achieve that success. economics teaches analytical and critical thinking skills useful to anyone. part of your students' success is their economic success as capable, creative, and productive members of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances. your students benefit from this education, but so does everyone else in society. we all benefit when better-educated citizens support economic policies that help our nation prosper. we all benefit from the capability, creativity, and productivity of our workforce, because nothing is more important to a healthy and growing economy. responsible consumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times, and stronger household finances overall can help sustain economic growth and mitigate a downturn.    stabilizing growth and mitigating a downturn, of course, are aspects of the federal reserve's mission. monetary policy can be a powerful tool to achieve these ends, but, in truth, its powers are dwarfed by larger forces, such as the productivity of the american people and the strength of their finances. by educating students and supporting their future contributions to the economy as workers and consumers, all teachers, especially economics teachers, are furthering our goals at the fed, so let me offer my further thanks for making our job easier.    to help support your work as teachers, the federal reserve board and the 12 reserve banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books to spread knowledge of economics, financial literacy, and the role of the fed in promoting a healthy economy and financial system. you can find some of those resources at our websites: federalreserve.gov and federalreserveeducation.org.    each of the reserve banks has community outreach and educational initiatives, and the outreach to economics teachers is coordinated by the system economic education group, which has been chaired by princeton williams.    at the board of governors, for some years we have operated a program called feded, which sends board employees into high schools throughout the washington, d.c., area. this outreach depends on several dozen volunteers from our staff--typically, recent college graduates--who help teach about the fed, economics and finance, and answer questions about work opportunities at the board. the federal reserve is dedicated to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the economics profession, and feded and other programs across the federal reserve system have helped advance this goal by reaching many schools with significant numbers of minority students.    let me leave it there, and again thank you for participating in this town hall, and thank you for the valuable work you do every school day."
2019-02-12,2744.73,"Chair_Powell_2019-Feb-12",1.28902502029669,"thank you for that kind introduction. i also want to thank hope enterprise corporation for inviting me to speak and mississippi valley state university (mvsu) for hosting us on its lovely campus.    it is a great pleasure to visit the mississippi delta. this region gave america the priceless musical heritage of the blues. it was also the site of some of the watershed events of the civil rights movement. but the delta, like many rural areas, has long confronted the challenge of poverty. today i'll speak about three areas of opportunity for addressing the challenges of rural poverty‑‑education and workforce development, entrepreneurship and small business development, as well as access to financial services--the topic of this conference.    mvsu's mission, providing young people an affordable college education, is itself a very powerful antipoverty program‑‑for its graduates, of course, but also for other communities that are touched by the university. mvsu opened its doors in 1950 as mississippi vocational college. the vocation of every member of its first class of 200 students was teaching. and even as it added other programs and became a full-fledged university, mvsu has continued to train many of the teachers who enrich, inspire, and spark the imagination of children who grow up in the delta.    mvsu and other historically black colleges and universities, or hbcus, play a crucial role in their communities. for much of the 20th century, hbcus were the primary means for black men and women to obtain the education needed for middle class or professional jobs. larger percentages of hbcu students, compared with students at predominantly white institutions, come from lower-income families and are the first in their families to attend college. this university and other hbcus support intellectual leadership, creativity, and innovation. i want to honor you for this proud history and for your continuing commitment to a better future for your students and for the region where many of your students were born and will build their lives and raise their families.1    challenges and opportunities in poor rural communities  today, data at the national level show a strong economy. unemployment is near a half-century low, and economic output is growing at a solid pace. but we know that prosperity has not been felt as much in some areas, including many rural places. the federal reserve can help by carrying out our monetary policy mission of supporting maximum employment and price stability. we also support strong communities by conducting research, promoting community development, and enforcing laws like the community reinvestment act, which helps ensure that people have adequate access to financial services wherever they live. we not only work with communities, we are in communities, through the presence of our 12 regional reserve banks.    poverty remains a challenge in many rural communities. indeed, 70 percent of the 473 ""persistent poverty"" counties in the united states are rural.2 unemployment and mortality rates remain high in these communities. along with lower incomes and wealth, the rate of business start-ups in these areas is lower. and their residents have less access to financial services. many of these disparities have existed for generations, and in some places have roots in a history of discrimination.    these areas also generally lack diverse industries and employment options and often have suffered from a decline in a traditional industry. in appalachia for instance, timber, coal mining, tobacco, and textiles have long been in decline.3 likewise, the number of jobs in agriculture and low-skilled manufacturing, mainstays of the delta's economy, is decreasing as a result of automation and outsourcing.4    education and workforce development  high-quality education and training play a crucial role in extending opportunity in rural areas, starting with early childhood education.5 but in many rural communities, access to high-quality preschool education is limited. mississippi is one of several mostly rural states where nearly half of residents lack access to good quality childcare, which is the main source of early childhood education.6 many decades of research also confirm that children who grow up in areas with better-quality k-12 schools or in classes with higher-quality teachers have better outcomes in life.7    later in life, workforce training and education are most effective when they train workers in skills needed by local employers. rural areas where traditional industries are declining and where new employers may be moving in often experience a mismatch between the skills of local workers and those demanded by the new employers. training and retraining programs tend to be centralized and concentrated in areas with a higher population density, which puts many rural areas at a disadvantage.8    education benefits both the student and the community. it is true that some young people leave their hometowns to seek greater opportunity. however, it is also true that young families, drawn back home by family and social ties, are the largest source of in-migration in many rural communities. young families are more likely to come if they believe their children will get a good education. returnees often bring back important skills and experiences and make meaningful contributions to the local economy.9    an excellent example is tim lampkin, an mvsu graduate. tim grew up and graduated from high school in clarksdale. after graduating from mvsu, he moved to mobile for work. he wasn't gone long, though, before he felt called to return to make his home here in the delta. since moving back, tim has founded several businesses, as well as a nonprofit that helps people of color start and grow their own businesses.    entrepreneurship and small business development  as with tim and his clients, entrepreneurship opportunities can motivate residents who have left rural communities to return home‑‑or to keep them from moving away in the first place. business ownership represents an important source of income and wealth for both owners and their employees. recognizing this fact, successful communities find ways to help residents turn what they know and do best, including skills they may have gained from industries in decline, into profitable small businesses.10 one example of a community taking this approach is clarksdale, mississippi.    about 10 years ago, civic and business leaders assessed what made clarksdale special and how those characteristics could help the community thrive. since clarksdale calls itself ""home of the blues,"" attracting tourists using the local blues culture seemed promising. over the years, clarksdale has created new jobs by investing to improve its downtown, and has supported local businesses that cater to tourists interested in the community's musical heritage.    this growth is also creating new businesses not directly related to tourism--businesses such as urgent and primary care of clarksdale. dr. mary williams opened her urgent care facility last spring, partly in response to the closure of nearby quitman county hospital. dr. williams worked with local organizations to develop a business plan and obtain the financing needed to open a business that is critical to the community.    dewitt, arkansas, is another rural community where entrepreneurship is sparking a local revival. dewitt is a town of about 3,000 people. like itta bena and many small towns, it has seen a steady decline in population over the past few decades. the economy there is a mix of manufacturing and agriculture, and many families have farmed the land for generations, such as the family of tami and troy hornbeck.    the hornbecks grew up in dewitt, starting and eventually selling a successful business built on a new soybean varietal that grows well in the south. more recently, they have been helping lead a new industry in their community using waste vegetable oil from local restaurants and oil pressed from camelina, a crop farmers are beginning to grow locally. this cooperative effort involves a partnership between a community college, a university, the local government, farmers and restaurants, and a community development financial institution, or cdfi, among others.11 while still in the early stages, it has led to the creation of several new businesses and imbued the town with a new sense of what is possible.    entrepreneurs such as the hornbecks and dr. williams need support to succeed, the kind of support hbcus and other institutions of higher education have long provided. mvsu itself is supporting rural minority entrepreneurs through its participation in the hbcu entrepreneurial ecosystem initiative, which teaches students how to start and grow a business.    but inspiring stories like these are not as common as they could be. entrepreneurship has the potential to play a greater role in poor rural areas, particularly in areas whose residents are predominantly black and other people of color. recent surveys have found relatively high levels of interest in owning businesses among young people of color.12 indeed, nationwide, black women represent one of the fastest growing groups of entrepreneurs.13 yet research by the federal reserve suggests people of color experience greater challenges in gaining access to credit to start or expand businesses, which leads me to my last topic and the focus of this forum: access to financial services.14    access to financial services  access to safe and affordable financial services is vital, especially among families with limited wealth‑‑whether they are looking to invest in education, start a business, or simply manage the ups and downs of life. family income and savings represent the largest source of funding for students' education. however, more than half of students or their families also borrow to finance their studies. and racial wealth disparities make black students more likely than white students to borrow for their education.15 similarly, racial wealth disparities mean access to credit is critical for would-be entrepreneurs who must borrow to supplement personal savings and support from friends and family. banks often consider credit scores when evaluating loan requests, however, and high-poverty regions tend to have a larger percentage of people with no established credit rating or a low credit score. this combination of low wealth and low credit scores limits access to credit or causes borrowers to turn to higher-cost credit.    fortunately, cdfis are helping potential borrowers improve their creditworthiness and providing them with safe and affordable credit. while cdfis fill a critical gap in some communities, most consumers use other banks and credit unions. in rural areas, this often means a community bank.16 industry consolidation has led to a long-term decline in the number of community banks. while most rural communities continue to be relatively well served, that is less often the case in communities with high-poverty rates.17    in 2018, federal reserve staff members met with leaders in rural areas across the country that had recently experienced a bank branch closure. we found that small businesses, older people, and people with limited access to transportation are most affected.18 we also learned that the loss of the branch often meant more than the loss of access to financial services; it also meant the loss of financial advice, local civic leadership, and an institution that brought needed customers to nearby businesses.    regulation and supervision need to be carefully tailored to suit the size and business model of different types of institutions. at the fed, we have renewed our efforts to avoid unnecessary regulatory burden on community banks, which provide essential credit in their local communities.    another means to address the issue of branch closures is the community reinvestment act, or cra, which encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they are chartered to serve. the cra has been an important tool for strengthening local communities. the trend toward fewer branches and increased use of technology to deliver financial services presents a particular challenge to our current approach to cra evaluations. specifically, the current regulations use a bank's branches to define its assessment area, the area for which it is evaluated for cra purposes. to the extent that banks serve much broader areas using online or other non-branch delivery systems, or have so many assessment areas that examiners cannot do a thorough evaluation in each, the financial needs of many rural communities may be overlooked. we believe that revisions to the cra's implementing regulations should more effectively encourage banks to seek opportunities in underserved areas.19    conclusion  to summarize my main points today, people in rural communities who are struggling with persistent poverty need access to high-quality education from preschool through college. they need support for their aspirations to own their own businesses. and they need access to safe and affordable credit.    i will conclude where i began, by applauding both mvsu and hope for their long-standing contribution toward bettering the lives of the people of itta bena and similar rural communities."
2019-02-28,2784.49,"Chair_Powell_2019-Feb-28",-0.282554666628479,"it is a pleasure to speak here this evening at the 87th awards dinner. tonight i will start with the near-term outlook for the u.s. economy. then i will turn to a topic that is inspired by the citizens budget commission's mission statement, which focuses on the ""well-being of future new yorkers."" i imagine that future new yorkers attending this dinner in 50 years may not look back on the near-term outlook in february 2018 as very interesting or important. so, tonight, after a brief review of the here and now, i will focus on an issue that is likely to be of more lasting importance: the need for policies that will support and encourage participation in the labor force, promote longer-term growth in our rapidly evolving economy, and spread the benefits of prosperity as widely as possible.    the state of the economy and near-term prospects  beginning with the here and now, congress has charged the federal reserve with achieving maximum employment and stable prices, two objectives that together are called the dual mandate. i am pleased to say that, judged against these goals, the economy is in a good place. the current economic expansion has been under way for almost 10 years. this long period of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down near historic lows (figure 1). the employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the disabled (figure 2).1 and while the unemployment rate for african americans and hispanics remains above the rates for whites and asians, the disparities have narrowed appreciably as the economic expansion has continued.    nearly all job market indicators are better than a few years ago, and many are at their most favorable levels in decades. after lagging earlier in the expansion, wages and overall compensation--pay plus benefits­­--are now growing faster than a few years ago (figure 3). it is especially encouraging that the labor force participation rate of people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, has been rising for the past three years. more plentiful jobs and rising wages are drawing more people into the workforce and encouraging others who might have left to stay.    in addition, business-sector productivity growth, which had been disappointing during the expansion, moved up in the first three quarters of 2018. rising productivity allows wages to increase without adding to inflation pressures. sustained productivity growth is a necessary ingredient for longer-run improvements in living standards.    the price stability side of our mandate is also in a good place. after remaining below our target for several years, inflation by our preferred measure averaged roughly 2 percent last year (figure 4). inflation has softened a bit since then, largely reflecting the recent drop in oil prices. futures markets and other indicators suggest that oil prices are unlikely to fall further, and if this proves correct, oil's drag on overall inflation will subside. consistent with that view, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and often provides a better signal of where inflation is heading, is currently running just a touch below our 2 percent objective. signs of upward pressure on inflation appear muted despite the strong labor market.    while the data i have discussed so far give a favorable picture of the economy, it is also important to acknowledge that not everyone has shared in the benefits of the expansion to the same extent, and that too many households still struggle to make ends meet.2 in addition, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals about the near-term outlook. for instance, growth has slowed in some major economies, particularly china and europe. uncertainty is elevated around some unresolved government policy issues, including brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. and financial conditions have tightened since last fall. while most of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer sentiment have moved lower. unexpectedly weak retail sales data for december also give reason for caution.    given the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the crosscurrents i just mentioned, the federal open market committee (fomc) will be patient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support our dual-mandate objectives. this common-sense risk-management approach has served the committee well in the past.    i will turn now from the near-term outlook to the question of how the economy will perform over the long haul.    longer-term challenges and opportunities  from 1991 through 2007, the economy expanded annually at about 3 percent, similar to the pace for much of second half of the 20th century. since 2007, however, growth has averaged just 1.6 percent. if the earlier 3 percent growth had persisted over the past 12 years, incomes today would be almost 20 percent higher than they now are. from the standpoint of future americans, if the slower growth persists for a half-century, incomes will end up roughly half of what they would have been.    why has growth slowed, and what can we do about it? to understand the causes of the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components: (1) growth in the cumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of output derived, on average, from each hour of work. we refer to output per hour of work as ""labor productivity."" from 1991 through 2007, when the economy expanded at a 3 percent average rate, hours worked increased about 1 percent a year and economy-wide productivity grew about 2 percent (figure 5).3 since 2007, both of these growth factors have slowed by about half, with hours worked annually increasing only 0.5 percent from 2008 to 2018 and productivity rising just 1 percent on average.4    growth in hours worked has slowed, in part, because of slower u.s. population growth. birth rates have edged down, and immigration has slowed. not only is the total population growing more slowly, but the share of the population in their prime working years is falling steadily as the very large baby-boom generation is moving into retirement. demographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise in the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now contributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy.    there is another factor contributing to the slower growth in hours, however, and this factor is more surprising and more troubling. to be counted as ""in the labor force,"" a person must either be employed or have looked for work within the past four weeks. the share of people of working age who are actually in the labor force has fallen significantly since the late 1990s. this decline raises the important question of why have people of working age increasingly chosen not to work.    the data suggest that there are both positive and more problematic forces at work. for example, among those aged 16 to 24, participation in the labor market has fallen from about 65 percent in the 1990s to 55 percent now (figure 6). but this drop in participation appears to reflect young people getting more education. the fraction of this age group who are neither in school nor in the labor force has held fairly constant at around 11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5 higher educational attainment is much more important in today's job market than in the past, and investing in education today has long-term benefits for both the student and for society.6 statistics confirm that higher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower unemployment, and higher wages.    turning to those aged 25 to 54, the participation picture is more troubling. among prime-age men, participation has been falling for more than 60 years, with the decline averaging about 1.5 percentage points per decade (figure 7). for women, participation rose over the second half of the 20th century until peaking in the late 1990s. since then, women's participation has dropped just a bit.    to put these numbers in context, let's look at data from other advanced economies. prime-age male participation has fallen some across most of these economies since 1995 (figure 8). but the decline in the united states has been much larger than most, and u.s. participation was below the middle of the pack at the outset. as a result, the united states now has the fourth lowest participation rate among 34 advanced economies. for women's participation, the details are different, but the bottom line is similar. in the mid-1990s, the united states ranked in the upper tier for prime-age women's participation, but since then participation by women has advanced rapidly in many countries while it has declined slightly in the united states. now the united states is sixth lowest among these 34 countries.    researchers have investigated numerous possible reasons for the decline in prime-age participation. among men, the drop in participation is much sharper for those with only a high school education or less. the drop for women is also sharper for those who are high school educated. this pattern is consistent with the idea that a modern economy demands ever-higher skills, and that workers without those skills are being left behind (figure 9). but the international experience suggests that this outcome is not inevitable: the drop in participation among those with less education is much smaller in some comparable countries than in the united states.7    the research into labor force participation in the united states and across the world does not find a magic fix, but it does suggest a variety of policies that might better prepare people for the modern workforce as well as support and reward labor force participation.8 i should note that the fed has neither the tools nor the mandate to directly address the forces that are holding back labor force participation. we can contribute by fostering a strong labor market, in accordance with our mandate. while it is not the fed's role to advocate particular labor force policies, i do want to put a spotlight on this important issue. i strongly believe policies that bring prime-age workers into productive employment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or educational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our economy.    the second factor accounting for the slowdown in gdp growth is the slower pace of labor productivity growth, or output per hour worked. when measured annually, labor productivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five-year averages, we can see that from 1975 through 2007, productivity growth averaged about 2 percent while fluctuating between about 1 and 4 percent (figure 10). since then, growth seems to have settled at the low end of that historical range. unlike the situation with labor force participation, the slowdown in productivity growth is also evident in most advanced economies, and the u.s. experience is roughly comparable to that of other countries.    there is an ongoing debate over the causes and implications of this global slowdown in productivity growth. some argue that the rapid growth seen over much of the 20th century was historically anomalous, and that we are destined to return to the slower growth of centuries past. others are more optimistic that strong growth can return.    many have noted that during the current expansion, investment and capital accumulation have been lower than in previous expansions, so perhaps we just need to invest more. unfortunately, it does not seem to be that simple. standard reasoning holds that capital-per-worker drives productivity. while we have had slower capital accumulation of late, we have also had slower growth in labor supply--hours worked. thus, capital per worker, according to some analysis, has continued to increase roughly at its pre-recession trend. in this view, the productivity problem is not simply one of inadequate investment.9    researchers have proposed several reasons why, even if the quantity of investment has kept up, recent investment may be leading to smaller productivity advances than in the past. the more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a productivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are embedded in recent investment.10 others suggest that productivity-advancing ideas are inherently harder to find and exploit than in the past, implying that slower productivity growth may be with us for the long haul.11 this debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. in the meantime, we should look for policies that will create an environment in which productivity can flourish.    we need policies that support innovation and create a favorable environment for investment in both the skills of workers and the tools they have. indeed, the recent tax reforms were designed in part to boost capital investment and thus productivity. once again, my goal tonight is to highlight the importance of growth-enhancing policies. because these policies are not the province of the fed, i will not advocate for particular approaches. instead, i will just observe that researchers and policy analysts have proposed many promising ideas that may be capable of attracting wide support. policies that succeed in enhancing productivity growth would greatly benefit future generations of americans.    conclusion  to conclude, the united states is currently in the midst of one of the longest economic expansions in our history. unemployment is low and inflation is close to our 2 percent objective. my colleagues and i on the fomc are focused on using our monetary policy tools to sustain those favorable conditions.    tonight i have also highlighted some longer-term challenges we face, including low labor force participation by prime-age workers and low productivity growth. by promoting macroeconomic stability, the fed helps create a healthy environment for growth. but these longer-term issues require policies that are more in the province of elected representatives. the nation would benefit greatly from a search for policies with broad appeal that could promote labor force participation and higher productivity, with benefits shared broadly across the nation."
2019-03-08,2743.07,"Chair_Powell_2019-Mar-8",-0.213173853099194,"thank you for the opportunity to speak here today at the stanford institute for economic policy research, a place dedicated to scholarship supporting policies to better peoples' lives. as today is international women's day, i would like to preface my remarks by commending the american economic association for highlighting the diversity challenges of the economics profession and charting a way forward. diversity is also a priority at the fed: i want the fed to be known within the economics profession as a great place for women, minorities, and others of diverse backgrounds to be respected, listened to, and happy.    just over 10 years ago, the federal open market committee (fomc, or the committee) lowered the federal funds rate close to zero, which we refer to as the effective lower bound, or elb. unable to lower rates further, the committee turned to two novel tools to promote the recovery. the first was forward guidance, which is communication about the future path of interest rates. the second was large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, which became known as quantitative easing, or qe. there is a range of views, but most studies have found that these tools provided significant support for the recovery. from the outset, the committee viewed them as extraordinary measures to be unwound, or ""normalized,"" when conditions ultimately warranted.    today i will explore some important features of normalization and then turn to what comes after. in some ways, we are returning to the pre-crisis normal. in other ways, things will be different. the world has moved on in the last decade, and attempting to re-create the past would be neither practical nor wise. as normalization moves into its later stages, my colleagues and i also believe that this is an important moment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade. we are therefore conducting a review of the fed's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. i will conclude with some thoughts on the review.    balance sheet normalization  between december 2008 and october 2014, the federal reserve purchased $3.7 trillion in longer-term treasury and agency securities in order to support the economy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer-term interest rates. consistent with the committee's long-stated intention, in october 2017 we started the process of balance sheet normalization. we began gradually reducing the reinvestment of payments received as assets matured or were prepaid, allowing our holdings to shrink. the process of reducing the size of the portfolio is now well along.    to frame the discussion of the final stages of normalization of the size of the balance sheet, it is useful to consider what the phrase ""normal balance sheet"" meant in the decades before the crisis. during that period, the main monetary policy decision for the fomc was choosing a target value for the federal funds rate. subject to that choice, the fed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet. this is a feature of ""normal"" that we are returning to: after normalization, the size of the fed's balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities.    to see what this means, consider figure 1, which shows the size of the fed's balance sheet through time, as measured by total liabilities. the values are stated as a percentage of the dollar value of gdp, or gross domestic product.1 liabilities began to grow sharply at the end of 2008 and continued to increase until the end of 2014. since that time, liabilities relative to gdp have fallen appreciably. to understand these changes, it is useful to focus on a snapshot of the balance sheet at three points in time: before the crisis, when the balance sheet was at its largest, and a rough projection for the end of this year (table 1).    in 2006, the dominant liability was currency held by the public, and the dominant asset was treasury securities. the fed's asset purchase programs increased the balance sheet from just below 6 percent to nearly 25 percent of gdp by the end of 2014.2 balance sheets must balance, of course, and the fed issued reserves as payment for the assets purchased. this action pushed reserves to nearly 15 percent of gdp.    the committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively. just how large that will be is uncertain, because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our liabilities. current estimates suggest, however, that something in the ballpark of the 2019:q4 projected values may be the new normal. the normalized balance sheet may be smaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for currency rises with the economy. in all plausible cases, the balance sheet will be considerably larger than before the crisis.    to understand the differences between the new and old normal, consider the final column in the table, which shows the change, measured in percentage points of gdp, between 2006:q4 and the 2019:q4 projection in the table. in this estimate, relative to before the crisis, the balance sheet will have grown as a share of gdp by about 10.6 percentage points. bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth, or about 5.6 percent of gdp. the crisis revealed that banks, especially the largest and most complex, faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought. because of both new liquidity regulations and improved management, banks now hold much higher levels of high-quality liquid assets than before the crisis. many banks choose to hold reserves as an important part of their strong liquidity positions.    the rest of the increase in liabilities is accounted for by three other categories. first, public currency holdings will have grown by 2.4 percentage points as a share of gdp. second, the u.s. treasury maintains an account at the fed, which has been running 1.4 percentage points higher as a share of gdp. and, third, other liabilities, which are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international financial system, will have grown by 1.1 percentage points.    as was the case before the crisis, the fomc's chosen operating regime for controlling short-term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate quantity of reserves. in january, the committee stated its intention to continue in our current regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some successor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the overnight reverse repo facility.3 in this system, active management of the supply of reserves is not required. thus, the supply of reserves must be ""ample,"" in the sense of being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors affecting the reserve market.4 put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market fluctuations.    while the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain, standard projections, such as those in the table, suggest we could be near that level later this year. as we feel our way cautiously to this goal, we will move transparently and predictably in order to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives. the committee is now well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet runoff later this year. once balance sheet runoff ends, we may, if appropriate, hold the size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to the desired level as other liabilities, such as currency, increase. we expect to announce further details of this plan reasonably soon.    there is no real precedent for the balance sheet normalization process, and we have adapted our approach along the way. in these final phases, we will adjust the details of our normalization plans if economic and financial conditions warrant. after decisions regarding the size of the balance sheet have been made, we will turn to remaining issues, such as the ultimate maturity composition of the portfolio. the committee has long stated that it intends to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of treasury securities.    forward guidance and the normalization of policy communication  the committee has also been normalizing communication about our policy after a decade of forward guidance. since december 2008, the fomc's postmeeting statement had contained ever-evolving forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the elb or about the gradual pace at which that rate would return to more normal levels. we removed the last elements of this crisis-era guidance in january.5 the federal funds rate is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate--the interest rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy. committee participants generally agree that this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. future adjustments will depend on what incoming data tell us about the baseline outlook and risks to that outlook.    policy communication will not simply revert to the ways of the early 2000s, however, for transparency advances have continued apace since then. the most significant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that, since january 2012, the fomc's quarterly summary of economic projections (sep) has included federal funds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future--often referred to as the ""dot plot."" returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the fomc's postmeeting statement presents a challenge, for the dot plot has, on occasion, been a source of confusion. until now, forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool for communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion.    for example, in early 2014, the committee's intentions were at odds with a common misreading of the dots, and chair yellen explained, ""[o]ne should not look to the dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the committee wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large. the fomc statement is the device that the committee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions . . . about the likely path of rates.""6 if the committee remains largely out of the business of explicit forward guidance, we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that sometimes surrounds the dots.    as readers of the fomc minutes will know, at our last meeting in january there was an impromptu discussion among some participants of general concerns about the dots. my own view is that, if properly understood, the dot plot can be a constructive element of comprehensive policy communication. let me follow my two predecessors as chair in attempting to advance that proper understanding.    each participant's dots reflect that participant's view of the policy that would be appropriate in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely. as someone who has filled out an sep projection 27 times over the last seven years, i can say that there are times when i feel that something like the ""most likely"" scenario i write down is, indeed, reasonably likely to happen. at other times, when uncertainty around the outlook is unusually high, i dutifully write down what i see as the appropriate funds rate path in the most likely scenario, but i do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted, for what is ""most likely"" may not be particularly likely. very different scenarios may be similarly likely. further, at times downside risks may deserve significant weight in policy deliberations. in short, as chairman bernanke explained, the sep projections are merely ""inputs"" to policy that do not convey ""the risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collective judgment.""7    effectively conveying our views about risks and their role in policy projections can be challenging at times, and we are always looking for ways to improve our communications. i have asked the communications subcommittee of the fomc to explore ways in which we can more effectively communicate about the role of the rate projections. for now, let me leave you with a cautionary tale about focusing too much on dots. here is a picture composed of different colored dots (figure 2). the meaning of it is not clear, although if you stare at it long enough you might see a pattern. but let's take a step back (figure 3). as you can see, if you are too focused on a few dots, you may miss the larger picture.    delivering on the fomc's intention to ultimately normalize policy continues to be a major priority at the fed. normalization is far along, and, considering the unprecedented nature of the exercise, it is proceeding smoothly. i am confident that we can effectively manage the remaining stages.    beyond normalization  we live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions around the world. at the fed, we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the public's trust. the fed has special responsibilities in this regard. our monetary policy independence allows us to serve the public without regard to short-term political considerations, which, as history has shown, is critical for sound monetary policymaking. but that precious grant of independence brings with it a special obligation to be open and transparent, welcoming scrutiny by the public and their elected representatives in congress. only in this way can the fed maintain its legitimacy in our democratic system.    among other initiatives, my colleagues and i on the fomc are undertaking a year-long review of the federal reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. the review will involve a series of ""fed listens"" events around the country. these will include town-hall-style meetings and a conference where academic and nonacademic experts will share their views. these events will inform staff work and fomc discussions as we plan for the future. while this is the first time the fed has opened itself up in this way, many central banks around the world have conducted similar reviews, and our approach builds on their experiences.    we believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has generally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes. consistent with the experience of other central banks with these reviews, the process is more likely to produce evolution rather than revolution. we seek no changes in law and we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the fed, or in the 2 percent inflation objective. while there is a high bar for adopting fundamental change, it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.    without ruling out other topics, we have highlighted three questions that seem particularly important at present (figure 4):    1. can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?    2. are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?    3. how can the fomc's communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?    i would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic. because interest rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8 thus, when a recession comes, the fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the elb may be more frequent. the post-crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended period at the elb, with slow growth and inflation well below target. persistently weak inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to support the economy during a downturn. it is therefore very important for central banks to find more effective ways to battle the low-inflation syndrome that seems to accompany proximity to the elb.    in the late 1990s, motivated by the japanese experience with deflation and sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of elb spells by adopting a makeup strategy.9 the simplest version goes like this: if a spell with interest rates near the elb leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal, once the elb spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target. in standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that prospect will promote anticipatory consumption and investment. this can substantially reduce the economic costs of elb spells.10 researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11 for example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses on either side of the target would be offset.    by the time of the crisis, there was a well-established body of model-based research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12 in light of this research, one might ask why the fed and other major central banks chose not to pursue such a policy.13 the answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and reality. for makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and businesses must be quite confident that the ""makeup stimulus"" is really coming. this confidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a downturn. in models, confidence in the policy is merely an assumption. in practice, when policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis, they had major questions about whether a central bank's promise of good times to come would have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public. part of the problem is that when the time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular--what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14    experience in the united states and around the world suggests that more frequent elb episodes could prove quite costly in the future. my fomc colleagues and i believe that we have a responsibility to the american people to consider policies that might promote significantly better economic outcomes. makeup strategies are probably the most prominent idea and deserve serious attention. they are largely untried, however, and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice. before they could be successfully implemented, there would have to be widespread societal understanding and acceptance--as i suggested, a high bar for any fundamental change. in this review, we seek to start a discussion about makeup strategies and other policies that might broadly benefit the american people.    conclusion  tonight i have focused on policy normalization and our efforts to engage the public in what may come after. before concluding, i will say a few words on current conditions and the outlook.    right now, most measures of the health and strength of the labor market look as favorable as they have in many decades. inflation will probably run a bit below our objective for a time due to declines in energy prices, but those effects are likely to prove transitory. core inflation, which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed over time, is quite close to 2 percent. despite this favorable picture, we have seen some cross-currents in recent months. with nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the committee has adopted a patient, wait-and-see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of policy.    considering monetary policy more broadly, we are inviting thorough public scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the fed can best exercise the precious monetary policy independence we have been granted. our goal is to enhance the public's trust in the federal reserve--our most valuable asset."
2019-03-11,2783.3,"Chair_Powell_2019-Mar-11",1.46660493534616,"good evening, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today.    the national community reinvestment coalition (ncrc) and its member organizations are at the forefront of an important conversation about how to ensure that low- and moderate-income communities are fairly served by the banking industry. the work that you do to promote access to basic banking services, affordable housing, and entrepreneurship opportunities supports the federal reserve and other agencies that enforce fair lending laws. the large number and variety of ncrc's local member organizations allow the ncrc to draw a detailed picture of how the federal reserve's policies affect lower-income communities, and we deeply appreciate the information that you share with us and the work that it represents.    as you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the struggles many individuals and families face in lower-income urban and rural communities. low- and moderate-income homeowners saw their wealth stripped away as home values dropped during the financial crisis and have not recovered as quickly or completely as others. because home equity has been the main source of wealth among low- and moderate-income people, the crisis dealt a particularly severe blow to these households. most americans rely on home equity to send their children to college, invest in their own education and training, or start or grow a business. these aspirations are the basis upon which a strong economy is built. that is why your work as ncrc member organizations offering financial counseling, homeownership education, and technical assistance for small businesses is as important as ever.    when lower-income individuals and families struggle, it harms their health and well-being and also weakens our economy. when people are connected to education, training, and other resources that help them secure good jobs and other opportunities, they are better prepared to care for themselves and their families and contribute to a strong economy.    the federal reserve has an extensive community development function, related to our responsibilities under the community reinvestment act (cra), that promotes partnerships between banks and community organizations to address local community and economic development needs. as you know, the cra requires federal banking regulators--the federal reserve, the office of the comptroller of the currency, and the federal deposit insurance corporation--to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. to complement the work we do with the other regulators to write regulations and guidance implementing cra, the federal reserve system's community development staff help banks understand and meet their responsibilities under the law. fed staff members also act as liaisons between banks and community organizations to identify local community development needs and solutions.    i know that you all are very interested in the agencies' activities related to possible revisions to the current cra regulations. my colleague, governor brainard, who represents the board in our interagency cra discussions, will be speaking to you tomorrow, so i will leave it to her to discuss our efforts in detail. but i do want to express my support for an interagency effort to revise the regulations to promote clarity and consistency in our evaluations of banks, particularly in light of the changes in the way bank products and services are delivered. we value the cra's role in meeting the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and want to be very careful that any revisions serve to strengthen the cra's purpose.    i commend your dedication to ensuring that all americans have fair access to the economic opportunities that our nation offers. i hope you have a productive conference, and i look forward to our ongoing conversation about how the federal reserve can help."
2019-05-09,2870.72,"Chair_Powell_2019-May-9",-0.302144181814403,"it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the federal reserve system's 11th community development research conference, cosponsored by the community development offices of all 12 federal reserve banks and the board of governors.    these biennial conferences are one manifestation of the federal reserve's deep commitment to supporting research that helps policymakers, community development practitioners, and researchers improve the economic well-being of families and communities. these gatherings also inform the federal reserve system's work in promoting consumer protection and community development, and i would like to thank all of you for your contributions to this conference.    this year our conference focuses on pathways to the middle class. while there are many definitions of ""middle class,"" i think we can agree that achieving a basic level of economic security is fundamental. surveys suggest that many americans believe being middle class means having a secure job and the ability to save.1 in recent decades, income growth for middle-income households has lagged behind that for high‑income households.2 in addition, economic resources differ markedly by race, education, occupation, geography, and other factors. those circumstances underscore a two-fold challenge for our country: fostering the conditions that will help lower-income families reach the middle class, while ensuring that middle-class status still provides the basic economic security that it has traditionally offered.    the conference organizers have sorted through the many research questions that will be addressed today and tomorrow and have taken away three key observations that are fundamental to addressing the challenges related to the middle class.    the first observation is to note the long-term decline in relative income growth and upward economic mobility for those in the middle. according to a number of measures, income has grown more slowly for middle-class households since the 1970s than for those with higher incomes, resulting in wider income inequality. the kind of generational improvements in living standards that were long the hallmark of the american middle class have steadily diminished. in the 1950s, better than 80 percent of children born in middle-class households grew up to out-earn their parents, but more recently only around half do. one factor in this decline is the increase in income inequality i just noted, and another is slower productivity growth. this conference will touch on other possible reasons for this decline in upward mobility and relative income, such as changes in the prospects for career advancement that vary by occupation and location.    the second observation is the widening gap in economic status and prospects between those with a college degree and those without one. in the 1960s, well over 90 percent of working-age men held a job, and there was very little difference in employment between those with or without a college degree. while the share of college-educated working-age men with a job has fallen from more than 95 percent in 1967 to around 90 percent in 2017, it has plunged for others. ninety-five percent of male high school graduates were working in 1967, but only about 80 percent of them were working as of 2017. among working-age men without a high school diploma, about 90 percent had a job in 1967 versus a bit more than 70 percent in 2017. for women of working age, the trends are less clear, but those without a college degree are also less likely to work today. research presented this morning will discuss some possible explanations for the divergence in employment, income, and other economic prospects between college grads and others.    the third observation is that the prospect of moving up the economic ladder depends on factors beyond effort and talent, including your family, the neighborhood you grow up in, and the quality of the primary and secondary schools you attend. your chances for attending college are much better if you are raised in a higher-income household, and that advantage has increased substantially since the 1980s. another factor is geography. some research indicates that economic prospects are better for those who grow up in neighborhoods with less income inequality, less concentrated poverty, and better performing schools. finally, across so many dimensions, we continue to see disparities in economic outcomes by race and ethnicity.    these issues are crucial. sound public policies can support families and businesses and help more americans reach and remain in the middle class. i look forward to hearing about your discussions over the next two days, and thank you, again, for your contributions."
2019-05-20,2840.23,"Chair_Powell_2019-May-20",-0.674936090896063,"it is a pleasure to be here at this important annual event sponsored and organized by the federal reserve bank of atlanta's center for financial innovation and stability. the risks in our financial system are constantly evolving. fifteen years ago, everyone was talking about whether households were borrowing too much. today everyone is talking about whether businesses are borrowing too much. this evening, i will focus on the implications of the increase in business debt over the past decade and review the steps the federal reserve and other agencies are taking to understand and limit the associated risks.    in public discussion of this issue, views seem to range from ""this is a rerun of the subprime mortgage crisis"" to ""nothing to worry about here."" at the moment, the truth is likely somewhere in the middle. to preview my conclusions, as of now, business debt does not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that would lead to broad harm to households and businesses should conditions deteriorate. at the same time, the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy weakens. the federal reserve continues to assess the potential amplification of such stresses on borrowers to the broader economy through possible vulnerabilities in the financial system, and i currently see such risks as moderate.    discussion  many commentators have observed with a sense of déjà vu the buildup of risky business debt over the past few years. the acronyms have changed a bit—""clos"" (collateralized loan obligations) instead of ""cdos"" (collateralized debt obligations), for example—but once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards. likewise, much of the borrowing is financed opaquely, outside the banking system. many are asking whether these developments pose a new threat to financial stability.    at the federal reserve, we take this possibility seriously. the fed and other regulators are using our supervisory tools and closely monitoring risks from the buildup of risky business debt. business debt has clearly reached a level that should give businesses and investors reason to pause and reflect. if financial and economic conditions were to deteriorate, overly indebted firms could well face severe strains. however, the parallels to the mortgage boom that led to the global financial crisis are not fully convincing. most importantly, the financial system today appears strong enough to handle potential business-sector losses, which was manifestly not the case a decade ago with subprime mortgages. and there are other differences: increases in business borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion, in contrast to the mortgage boom; business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble, as mortgage debt was; and clo structures are much sounder than the structures that were in use during the mortgage credit bubble.    could the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than currently appreciated? my colleagues and i continually ask ourselves that question. we are also taking multiple steps to better understand and address the potential risks. in conjunction with other u.s. regulatory agencies, both domestically through the financial stability oversight council (fsoc) and internationally through the financial stability board (fsb), we are monitoring developments, assessing unknowns, and working to develop a clearer picture. we are also using our supervisory tools to hold the banks we supervise to strong risk-management standards. and we are using our stress tests to ensure banks' resilience even in severely adverse business conditions.    the rise of business leverage  let's start with the basic facts. many measures confirm that the business sector has significantly increased its borrowing as the economy has expanded over the past decade. business debt relative to the size of the economy is at historic highs. corporate debt relative to the book value of assets is at the upper end of its range over the past few decades (figure 1). and investment-grade corporate debt has shifted closer to the edge of speculative grade.    at the moment, the business sector is quite healthy overall. business income is strong, reflecting healthy profit margins. and because interest rates are quite low by historical standards, the costs of servicing today's higher levels of debt remain low relative to business income (figure 2). despite crosscurrents, the economy is showing continued growth, strong job creation, and rising wages, all in a context of muted inflation pressures.    but if a downturn were to arrive unexpectedly, some firms would face challenges. not only is the volume of debt high, but recent growth has also been concentrated in the riskier forms of debt. among investment-grade bonds, a near-record fraction is at the lowest rating—a phenomenon known as the ""triple-b cliff."" in a downturn, some of these borrowers could be downgraded into high-yield territory, which would require some investors to sell their holdings, thereby confronting traditional high-yield investors with a sudden influx of bonds.    there have also been sizable shifts within the non-investment-grade, or riskier, debt universe. higher-risk businesses have traditionally funded themselves with a mix of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. over time, the balance between the two has swung back and forth because of investor demand, the interest rate environment, and other factors. in the past few years, leveraged loans have grown far more quickly (figure 3). in fact, while net new issuance of high-yield bonds in 2018 was close to nil, leveraged loans outstanding rose 20 percent and now stand at more than $1 trillion. so far this year, issuance of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans has been more balanced. in addition, underwriting standards have weakened. with leveraged loans, covenants intended to protect lenders may be an endangered species; more loans now feature high debt-to-earnings ratios; and the use of optimistic projections including ""earnings add-backs"" is becoming more common.    the rise in riskier business borrowing has been funded principally by nonbank lenders. collateralized loan obligations are now the largest lenders, with about 62 percent of outstanding leveraged loans (figure 4). these lenders are actively managed securitization vehicles that mostly buy higher-risk assets like leveraged loans. clos, in turn, are funded by a slice of equity and layers of debt of varying seniority. after clos, mutual funds are the next-largest vehicle for holding leveraged loans, with about 20 percent of the market. these funds allow investors to redeem their shares daily, although the underlying loans take longer to sell. as a result, investors may react to financial stress by trying to redeem their shares before the funds have sold their most liquid assets. widespread redemptions by investors, in turn, could lead to widespread price pressures, which could affect all holders of loans, including clos and those that hold clos.    risks to financial stability: using the framework deployed since the crisis  as you can see, there are similarities to the subprime mortgage crisis. as with the mortgage boom, the business debt story begins with rapid growth of debt to new highs and a surge in lending to risky borrowers made possible by aggressive underwriting using securitization vehicles.    but there are also important differences. one difference is that financial authorities now closely monitor financial stability vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis, armed with lessons learned from the crisis. the board of governors meets at least four times a year to assess threats to the financial system and is constantly monitoring developments. we use a checklist of potential financial vulnerabilities that we have described elsewhere, most recently in the financial stability report we published earlier this month.1 this approach gives us a way to organize and weigh the mass of facts, anecdotes, and speculation we confront as we monitor financial stability.    in assessing financial stability risks, we constantly consult our four-point checklist: borrowing by businesses and households, valuation pressures, leverage in the financial system, and funding risk. if households or businesses have borrowed too much, they will be forced to cut back spending and investing or even default if their incomes fall or the value of the collateral backing their loans declines. valuation pressures give us a sense of overall risk appetite and, should investors lose that appetite, how far prices could fall. if lenders face defaulting borrowers and have too little loss-absorbing capacity, they risk insolvency. at best, they will cut back on lending to other borrowers, dragging the economy down. at worst, they will fail, which can lead to severe economic damage to households and businesses. finally, when the financial system funds long-maturity assets with short-maturity liabilities, we risk a classic ""fast burn"" crisis—a bank run, or its equivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking.2    in our framework, the story of the mid-2000s goes something like this: amid a self-reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion, households borrowed (and lenders lent) far too much, and property prices rose far too high. financial institutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much. and the financial sector was highly susceptible to a run because it funded risky, long-maturity mortgages with extended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short-maturity liabilities.    let's compare this story with the current situation using our four-point checklist, beginning with borrowing by businesses and households. business debt has grown faster than gross domestic product (gdp) for several years and today is high. but the growth in the ratio of business debt to gdp in the past decade is much less than the growth in household debt to gdp that we saw in the run-up to the global financial crisis. back then, household debt grew from 60 percent of gdp to 90 percent, or by half (figure 5). at its recent low, business debt was 65 percent of gdp. now, even after rapid growth, it is still below 75 percent of gdp. overall, the increase in business debt relative to the size of the economy is one-third the increase in household debt seen in the previous decade. business debt rises in expansions. it is a steady upward plod in borrowing over the long expansion—not a rapid expansion—that has now brought business debt to gdp back to historic highs. seen this way, the current situation looks typical of business cycles. the mortgage credit boom was, because of its magnitude and speed, far outside historical norms.3    as for household debt, we see that household debt-to-income ratios have steadily declined post-crisis. moreover, a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime. all told, household debt burdens appear much more manageable.    our second factor—valuation pressures—also points to moderate risks to financial stability. valuations are high across several financial markets. equity prices have recently reached new highs, and corporate bond and loan spreads are narrow. both commercial and residential property prices have moved above their long-run relationship with rents, although price gains slowed substantially last year. all of these developments point to strong risk appetite—as might be expected given the strong economy. but there does not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices, as was the case in the run-up to the financial crisis. while borrowing by businesses has been strong, it is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing, whose collapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses. instead, the increase in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors, including technology, oil and gas production, and manufacturing.    regarding the third factor—leverage in the financial system—today banks at the core of the financial system are fundamentally stronger and more resilient. our post-crisis regulatory framework is based on robust capital requirements backed by strong stress tests, resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system (figure 6). these stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad macroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system. we publish the scenarios that describe the macro and financial developments every year by mid-february and release the test results in june. in the pre-crisis environment, supervisors focused more on the most likely outcomes, not on these tail risks. since we began routine stress-testing in 2011, the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized by major stress in the corporate sector, where large numbers of firms default on their loans and bonds. as actual economic conditions have improved, the scenarios have gotten tougher. the most recent stress tests indicate that, even after the losses from the scenario, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above the levels those banks had before the crisis. loss-absorbing capacity elsewhere in the financial system is also much improved. leverage at broker-dealers is far below levels before the crisis and remains low relative to the norms of the past several decades. insurers also appear well capitalized.    as for our fourth factor—funding risk—the susceptibility of the financial system to runs also appears low. in part because of the post-crisis regulatory regime, large banks hold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and rely relatively little on short-term wholesale funding (figure 7). money market funds hold much safer assets. and clos, which have facilitated the growth of leveraged loans, have stable funding: investors commit funds for lengthy periods, so they cannot, through withdrawals, force clos to sell assets at distressed prices.    addressing the risks: monitoring and acting  overall, vulnerabilities to financial stability from business debt and other factors do not appear elevated. we take the risks from business debt seriously but think that the financial system appears strong enough to handle potential losses. we also know that our dynamic financial system does not stand still. we can always learn more about financial markets, and we will always act to address emerging risks. together with our domestic and international counterparts, we are monitoring developments in business debt markets, working to develop and share data on how these markets operate, studying ways to further strengthen the system, and working to ensure that banks are properly managing the business debt risks they have taken on.    through the fsoc, the banking and market regulators coordinate our monitoring of financial conditions. in recent meetings, the fsoc has discussed leveraged lending in depth. we recognize that each regulator directly sees only a part of the larger picture, and we are working to stitch these parts together so we can collectively see that larger picture and the risks it holds. for example, the securities and exchange commission is examining the potential for liquidity strains at mutual funds, and the commodity futures trading commission is working to understand the use of derivatives to hedge risks associated with leveraged loans.    what else are we watching for? business debt growth has moderated somewhat since early 2018, but this might be just a pause. another sharp increase in debt, unless supported by strong fundamentals, could increase vulnerabilities appreciably. businesses, investors, and lenders need to focus on these vulnerabilities—as will the federal reserve.    in addition, regulators, investors, and market participants around the world would benefit greatly from more information on who is bearing the ultimate risk associated with clos. we know that the u.s. clo market spans the globe, involving foreign banks and asset managers. but right now, we mainly know where the clos are not—only $90 billion of the roughly $700 billion in total clos are held by the largest u.s. banks. that is certainly good news for domestic banks, but in a downturn institutions anywhere could find themselves under pressure, especially those with inadequate loss-absorbing capacity or runnable short-term financing. the federal reserve is participating in international efforts, under the auspices of the fsb, to improve our knowledge of these key issues. through the fsb, we are focused on determining the size of the global leveraged loan market and the holders of the loans as an important step toward a better understanding of the underlying risks.    beyond monitoring markets and collecting new data, several supervisory efforts are also under way. to complement the quantitative analysis in our stress tests, our supervisors have been qualitatively assessing how well banks are managing the risks associated with leveraged lending. through the shared national credit program, which evaluates large syndicated loans, our supervisors are continuing to work with their counterparts at the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation to ensure that banks are properly managing the risks of losses they face from participating in the leveraged lending market.    conclusion  let me wrap up with three thoughts. first, business debt is near record levels, and recent issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments. as a result, some businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates. a highly leveraged business sector could amplify any economic downturn as companies are forced to lay off workers and cut back on investments. investors, financial institutions, and regulators need to focus on this risk today, while times are good.    second, today business debt does not appear to present notable risks to financial stability. the debt-to-gdp ratio has moved up at a steady pace, in line with previous expansions and neither fueled by nor fueling an asset bubble. moreover, banks and other financial institutions have sizable loss-absorbing buffers. the growth in business debt does not rely on short-term funding, and overall funding risk in the financial system is moderate.    third, we cannot be satisfied with our current level of knowledge about these markets, particularly the vulnerability of financial institutions to potential losses and the possible strains on market liquidity and prices should investors exit investment vehicles holding leveraged loans. we are committed to better understanding the areas where our information is incomplete. this commitment includes coordination with other domestic and international agencies to understand who is participating in business lending and how their behavior could potentially amplify stress events."
2019-06-04,2803.27,"Chair_Powell_2019-Jun-4",2.14323452786533,"good morning. i am very pleased to welcome you here today. this conference is part of a first-ever public review by the federal open market committee of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications. we have a distinguished group of experts from academics and other walks of life here to share perspectives on how monetary policy can best serve the public.    i’d like first to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters. we do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. we are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u.s. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. my comments today, like this conference, will focus on longer-run issues that will remain even as the issues of the moment evolve.    while central banks face a challenging environment today, those challenges are not entirely new. in fact, in 1999 the federal reserve system hosted a conference titled ""monetary policy in a low inflation environment."" conference participants discussed new challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the great inflation.1 they focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what unconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell to what we now call the effective lower bound (elb). even though the bank of japan was grappling with the elb as the conference met, the issue seemed remote for the united states. the conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a reuters wire service story titled ""fed conference timing on inflation odd, but useful"" emphasized the remoteness of the risk.2 participants at the conference could not have anticipated that only 10 years later, the world would be engulfed in a deep financial crisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive use of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate.    the next time policy rates hit the elb—and there will be a next time—it will not be a surprise. we are now well aware of the challenges the elb presents, and we have the painful experience of the global financial crisis and its aftermath to guide us. our obligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best position deal with our next encounter with the elb. and with the economy growing, unemployment low, and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the public broadly on these topics.    the review has several parts, all of which are intended to open our monetary policy to critical examination. we are holding a series of fed listens events around the country to help us understand the perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and with varied interests. this conference and many other engagements will help us bring to bear the best thinking from policymakers and experts. beginning later this year, the fomc will devote time at a series of our regular meetings to assess lessons from these events, supported by staff analysis performed throughout the federal reserve system. we will publicly report the outcome of our discussions. in the meantime, anyone who is interested in participating or learning more can find information on the federal reserve board's website.3    before turning to the specifics of the review, i want to focus a little more closely on the challenges we face today. for a reference point, at the time of the 1999 conference, the united states was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent—not so different from today.4 macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the phillips curve, the level of the natural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growth—questions that are also with us today.5    the big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 5.2 percent—which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away from the elb. since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the effective decline is even larger.6 the combination of lower real interest rates and low inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will fall to the elb in a downturn.    as the experience of the past decade showed, extended elb episodes can be associated with painfully high unemployment and slow growth or recession. economic weakness puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and reinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth. in addition, over time, inflation has become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization. this insensitivity can be a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high, but it means that much greater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target in a recovery. using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift inflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.    in short, the proximity of interest rates to the elb has become the preeminent monetary policy challenge of our time, tainting all manner of issues with elb risk and imbuing many old challenges with greater significance. for example, the behavior of inflation7 now draws much sharper focus. when nominal interest rates were around 4 or 5 percent, a low-side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the elb. but the world has changed. core inflation is currently running a bit below 2 percent on a trailing 12-month basis. in this setting, a similar low-side surprise, if it were to persist, would bring us uncomfortably closer to the elb. my fomc colleagues and i must—and do—take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a robust economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in inflation expectations. at the heart of the review is the evaluation of potential changes to our strategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.    the elb problem also complicates the fomc's efforts to achieve transparency and accountability. the fed, like most major central banks, is insulated from short-term political pressures. in our democracy, that insulation carries with it an obligation for us to be transparent and publicly accountable. when policy rates reached the elb during the crisis, central banks resorted to what were then new, untested tools to pursue their mandated goals. these tools are no longer new, but their efficacy, costs, and risks remain less well understood than the traditional approaches to central banking. my fomc colleagues and i are committed to explaining why the use of these tools in the wake of the crisis was a prudent and effective approach to pursuing our congressional mandate and why tools like these are likely to be needed again. our review is but one part of our efforts to engage with the public on these matters.    let me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions:    can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?  are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?  how can the fomc's communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?  these questions are quite broad, and my colleagues and i come to them with open minds. we believe our current policy framework is working well, and we have made no decisions about particular changes. in fact, the review is still in its early stages.    the first question raises the issue of whether the fomc should use makeup strategies in response to elb risks. by the time of the 1999 conference, research was beginning to show that—in models, at least—such strategies could substantially reduce the unemployment and other costs of elb spells.8 the simplest version goes like this: suppose that a spell with interest rates near the elb leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal. but what if the central bank promised credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target? in the models, the prospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could greatly reduce the pain of being at the elb.9 policymakers discussed this reasoning in the wake of the crisis, but neither the fed nor any other major central bank chose to pursue such a policy.10 why? for makeup strategies to work, households and businesses must go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn. in theory, they would do this based on their confidence that the central bank will deliver the makeup stimulus at some point—perhaps years in the future. in models, great confidence in central bankers is achieved by assumption. despite the flattering nature of this assumption, crisis-era policymakers had major questions about whether their promise of good times to come would really have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public. part of the problem was that the groundwork had not been laid in advance of the downturn—a problem we could hope to fix well before next time. policymakers also had deeper concerns about the legitimacy and effectiveness of attempting to bind some future fomc to take actions that could be objectionable from a short-term perspective when the time came to deliver.11    research on makeup strategies has begun to grapple more seriously with the credibility questions.12 but important questions remain. to achieve buy-in by households and businesses, a comprehensible, credible, and actionable makeup strategy will need to be followed by years of central bank policy consistent with that strategy.    the second question asks about the adequacy of the fed's toolkit for providing stimulus when facing the elb. in the united states, we used several different formulations of both forward guidance and large‑scale purchases of longer-term securities.13 while views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use, the unemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored, outcomes that were favorable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other advanced economies. my own view is that these policies provided meaningful support for demand, but that they should not be thought of as a perfect substitute for our traditional interest rate tool. in any case, we have a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate what mix of these tools is likely to work best when the next elb episode arrives.    perhaps it is time to retire the term ""unconventional"" when referring to tools that were used in the crisis. we know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some form in future elb spells, which we hope will be rare. we now have a significant body of evidence regarding the effectiveness, costs, and risks of these tools, including those used by the fomc and others tried elsewhere. our plans must take advantage of this growing understanding as assessments are refined.    the third question concerns improving communication, which i discussed earlier from the standpoint of governance and accountability. but transparency also plays a central role in policy effectiveness through its effects on the expectations of households and businesses. of course, this was the major insight behind the transparency revolution in central banking over the past few decades. today, central banks publicly share a large and ever-increasing amount of information about policy. but policymakers and commentators inside and outside central banks sometimes question whether all of the transparency adds up to effective communication.14    the fomc's famous dot plot is one example. a focus on the median forecast amounts to emphasizing what the typical fomc participant would do if things go as expected. but we have been living in times characterized by large, frequent, unexpected changes in the underlying structure of the economy.15 in this environment, the most important policy message may be about how the central bank will respond to the unexpected rather than what it will do if there are no surprises. unfortunately, at times the dot plot has distracted attention from the more important topic of how the fomc will react to unexpected economic developments. in times of high uncertainty, the median dot might best be thought of as the least unlikely outcome.    let me conclude by saying that i look forward to our discussions here and to the ongoing work of the review that lies ahead. we need the best tools and strategies possible for dealing with the challenges we now face, and we must communicate them in a clear and credible way. my colleagues and i welcome your best thinking on these issues."
2019-06-25,2917.38,"Chair_Powell_2019-Jun-25",-0.949632471522902,"good afternoon. it is a pleasure to speak at the council on foreign relations. i will begin with a progress report on the broad public review my federal reserve colleagues and i are conducting of the strategy, tools, and communication practices we use to achieve the objectives congress has assigned to us by law—maximum employment and price stability, or the dual mandate. then i will discuss the outlook for the u.s. economy and monetary policy. i look forward to the discussion that will follow.    during our public review, we are seeking perspectives from people across the nation, and we are doing so through open public meetings live-streamed on the internet. let me share some of the thinking behind this review, which is the first of its nature we have undertaken. the fed is insulated from short-term political pressures—what is often referred to as our ""independence."" congress chose to insulate the fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence.    along with this independence comes the obligation to explain clearly what we are doing and why we are doing it, so that the public and their elected representatives in congress can hold us accountable. but real accountability demands more of us than clear explanation: we must listen. we must actively engage those we serve to understand how we can more effectively and faithfully use the powers they have entrusted to us. that is why we are formally and publicly opening our decisionmaking to suggestions, scrutiny, and critique. with unemployment low, the economy growing, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective, this is a good time to undertake such a review.    another factor motivating the review is that the challenges of monetary policymaking have changed in a fundamental way in recent years. interest rates are lower than in the past, and likely to remain so. the persistence of lower rates means that, when the economy turns down, interest rates will more likely fall close to zero—their effective lower bound (elb). proximity to the elb poses new problems to central banks and calls for new ideas. we hope to benefit from the best thinking on these issues.    at the heart of the review are our fed listens events, which include town hall–style meetings in all 12 federal reserve districts. these meetings bring together people with wide-ranging perspectives, interests, and expertise. we also want to benefit from the insights of leading economic researchers. we recently held a conference at the federal reserve bank of chicago that combined research presentations by top scholars with roundtable discussions among leaders of organizations that serve union workers, low- and moderate-income communities, small businesses, and people struggling to find work.    we have been listening. what have we heard? scholars at the chicago event offered a range of views on how well our monetary policy tools have effectively promoted our dual mandate. we learned more about cutting-edge ways to measure job market conditions. we heard the latest perspectives on what financial and trade links with the rest of the world mean for the conduct of monetary policy. we heard scholarly views on the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability. and we heard a review of the clarity and the efficacy of our communications.    like many others at the conference, i was particularly struck by two panels that included people who work every day in low- and middle-income communities. what we heard, loud and clear, was that today's tight labor markets mean that the benefits of this long recovery are now reaching these communities to a degree that has not been felt for many years. we heard of companies, communities, and schools working together to bring employers the productive workers they need—and of employers working creatively to structure jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life beyond the workplace. we heard that many people who, in the past, struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and better chapters to their life stories. all of this underscores how important it is to sustain this expansion.    the conference generated vibrant discussions. we heard that we are doing many things well, that we have much we can improve, and that there are different views about which is which. that disagreement is neither surprising nor unwelcome. the questions we are confronting about monetary policymaking and communication, particularly those relating to the elb, are difficult ones that have grown in urgency over the past two decades. that is why it is so important that we actively seek opinions, ideas, and critiques from people throughout the economy to refine our understanding of how best to use the monetary policy powers congress has granted us.    beginning soon, the federal open market committee (fomc) will devote time at its regular meetings to assess the lessons from these events, supported by analysis by staff from around the federal reserve system. we will publicly report the conclusions of our discussions, likely during the first half of next year. in the meantime, anyone who is interested in learning more can find information on the federal reserve board's website.1    let me turn now from the longer-term issues that are the focus of the review to the nearer-term outlook for the economy and for monetary policy. so far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well. solid fundamentals are supporting continued growth and strong job creation, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows. although inflation has been running somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective, we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market. along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth. when the fomc met at the start of may, tentative evidence suggested these crosscurrents were moderating, and we saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.    since then, the picture has changed. the crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. these concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through to incoming data. for example, the limited available evidence we have suggests that investment by businesses has slowed from the pace earlier in the year.    against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my fomc colleagues, like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with unemployment remaining near historic lows. inflation is expected to return to 2 percent over time, but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year. however, the risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown.    last week, my fomc colleagues and i held our regular meeting to assess the stance of monetary policy. we did not change the setting for our main policy tool, the target range for the federal funds rate, but we did make significant changes in our policy statement. since the beginning of the year, we had been taking a patient stance toward assessing the need for any policy change. we now state that the committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.    the question my colleagues and i are grappling with is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy accommodation. many fomc participants judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened. but we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment. doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook. we will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."
2019-07-09,2979.63,"Chair_Powell_2019-Jul-9",0.123657991565728,"good morning everyone and thank you to president rosengren and the boston fed for hosting this conference.    the federal reserve is strongly committed to stress testing as a cornerstone of our bank supervisory and financial stability missions. stress testing is perhaps the most successful supervisory innovation of the post-crisis era. but if stress tests are to continue to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead to keep pace with the ever-changing financial system, as they have since the first round of tests in 2009.    before looking to the future, let me recall a bit of history. a little more than 10 years ago, the united states and the world teetered on the brink of economic catastrophe. what was urgently needed was a way to restore confidence in the financial system—a daunting challenge. neither the banks, nor the regulators, nor the public had a reliable sense of the strength and resilience of our major banks. the announcement of forward-looking stress-testing results in may 2009 helped restore confidence and stabilize banks by providing a credible and independent picture of their finances.1 these original stress tests evolved into the comprehensive capital analysis and review, or ccar, program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and supervision by the fed, as a forward-looking endeavor.    since 2009, large banks have added more than $800 billion in common equity capital, giving them a much thicker cushion to deal with losses. banks have gotten much better at assessing and managing their risks, effectively tracking commitments across their organizations, anticipating capital needs, and planning for different scenarios.    the stress tests of the future—5 and 10 years from now—will need to continue to ensure that banks remain able, even in a severe downturn, to provide the credit that households and businesses depend on. as financial institutions and the financial system evolve, stress testing will need to keep up. when the next episode of financial instability presents itself, it may do so in a messy and unexpected way. banks will need to be ready not just for expected risks, but for unexpected ones. thus, the tests will need to vary from year to year, and to explore even quite unlikely scenarios.    if the stress tests do not evolve, they risk becoming a compliance exercise, breeding complacency from both supervisors and banks. we might also, inadvertently, encourage the development of a banking system where, over time, all banks would look much alike rather than the banking system we want and need, one with diverse institutions with different business models. we simply can't let these things happen.    the purpose of today's gathering is to help us think about how to ensure the tests continue to foster a dynamic banking system, financial stability, and a healthy and growing economy. we have invited a wide range participants—fellow regulators, bankers, analysts, academics, and community groups—with diverse perspectives. because we do not claim a monopoly on knowledge or wisdom, we have invited many who have disagreed with us in the past. i strongly believe that diverse perspectives and healthy debate will sharpen our thinking and lead us to better answers.    i'm sorry i'm not able to be with you today. and i want to particularly thank all of the speakers, discussants, and other participants for helping us grapple with the challenges of ensuring that tomorrow's stress tests remain as effective and vigorous as they are today. thank you."
2019-07-16,3004.04,"Chair_Powell_2019-Jul-16",-0.340377533755771,"seventy-five years ago this month, the foremost economic and policy minds of their generation gathered in a sleepy mountain town in new england. while world war ii still raged, they envisioned a new international monetary system with rules, procedures, and institutions—including the international monetary fund (imf) and the world bank—to promote recovery and stability in a war-ravaged world.    today we gather in paris, the city of light, to recognize their vision. the bretton woods institutions played a pivotal role after the war in rebuilding economies and in facilitating the international economic relations that are essential to prosperity. generations later, the world bank and the imf continue to play important roles in fostering global monetary cooperation, financial stability, and international trade, as well as in promoting sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty.    in 1944, those who sat around the table at the mount washington hotel knew that the trauma and tragedy of the war and the great depression had fundamentally altered the economic systems that preceded them. for us, around our dinner tables tonight, a decade has passed since the global financial crisis. although in no way comparable to the devastating events of the 1930s and 1940s, the crisis represents the deepest and broadest financial upheaval since that era, and in many ways, we, too, are grappling with a changed world.    today's conference has looked at this post-crisis environment and the issues we now face from many angles. i am grateful to the banque de france for organizing this important event and to the outstanding speakers for their deep insights. tonight i will offer some thoughts on this new environment. i will begin with a discussion of current economic conditions in the united states, and then highlight some significant structural changes in the environment facing monetary policymakers in the post-crisis era. finally, i will consider how these structural changes are affecting the framework in which we conduct monetary policy, highlighting the federal reserve system's ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications.    the u.s. economy is now in its 11th consecutive year of growth. unemployment has steadily declined from its 10 percent post-crisis peak and has now remained at or below 4 percent for more than a year, the longest stretch in a half century. a strong labor market with plentiful job openings has supported labor force participation. after rising only grudgingly early in the recovery, wages have moved up the past few years. some groups, such as african americans, hispanics, and rural americans, continue to face long-standing challenges, but the benefits of this strong job market are increasingly widely shared. at outreach events we are holding across the united states, we are hearing loud and clear that this long recovery is now benefiting low- and moderate-income communities to a greater extent than has been felt for decades. many people who have struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and better chapters to their life stories.    solid growth has sustained this strong labor market. most recently, u.s. gross domestic product (gdp) increased at an annual rate of just over 3 percent in the first quarter, similar to last year's strong pace. but first-quarter growth was driven largely by net exports and inventories—two volatile spending categories that are typically not dependable indicators of ongoing momentum. indeed, overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated. growth in consumer spending, which was soft in the first quarter, looks to have bounced back, but business fixed investment growth seems to have slowed notably. moreover, the manufacturing sector has been weak since the beginning of the year, in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker growth in the global economy, and, as our business contacts tell us, concerns about trade tensions.    despite low unemployment and solid overall growth, inflation pressures remain muted. after running close to the federal open market committee's (fomc) symmetric 2 percent objective over much of last year, both overall consumer price inflation and core inflation moved down earlier this year. we currently estimate that the change in the core personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index was 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in june.    in our baseline outlook, we expect growth in the united states to remain solid, labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up and run near 2 percent. uncertainties about this outlook have increased, however, particularly regarding trade developments and global growth. in addition, issues such as the u.s. federal debt ceiling and brexit remain unresolved. fomc participants have also raised concerns about a more prolonged shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent target. market-based measures of inflation compensation have shifted down, and some survey-based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historical ranges.    many fomc participants judged at the time of our most recent meeting in june that the combination of these factors strengthens the case for a somewhat more accommodative stance of policy. we are carefully monitoring these developments and assessing their implications for the u.s economic outlook and inflation, and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.    we will also assess these developments in the context of the broader structural changes monetary policymakers have been facing since the great recession. i will focus on three tonight: the changed macroeconomic backdrop, the expanded toolkit, and the heightened focus on communication and transparency.    in the united states, from the mid-1980s to right before the great recession, pce inflation averaged 2.6 percent a year, gdp growth 3.4 percent, and the interest rate on a 10-year treasury note 6.5 percent. since the trough of the great recession, average inflation and output growth are around 1 percentage point lower, and the 10-year treasury rate has averaged 2.4 percent. these declines are not unique to the united states. average inflation rates for the other major advanced economies have declined by almost half, while the inflation rates of major emerging market economies are less than one-fifth of what they were. indeed, with few exceptions, we are all facing lower rates of interest, growth, and inflation. in a number of countries, including the united states, these declines have been accompanied by strong labor markets and a much lower unemployment rate.    such changes in the macroeconomic environment are significant because the long-run normal levels of inflation, output, interest rates, and the unemployment rate are important structural features by which we guide policy. standard estimates of the natural rate of unemployment—u*—and the neutral rate of interest—r*—have been declining for 2 decades, and particularly since the crisis.    many factors are contributing to these changes—well-anchored inflation expectations in the context of improved monetary policy, demographics, globalization, slower productivity growth, greater demand for safe assets, and weaker links between unemployment and inflation. and these factors seem likely to persist. if that happens, the neutral rate of interest will remain low, and policymakers will continue to operate in an environment in which the risk of hitting the effective lower bound is much higher than before the crisis. this proximity to the lower bound poses new complications for central banks and calls for new ideas.    it is true that many of these features have been with us for some time. trend inflation, productivity, and interest rates were declining well before the crisis. but, for monetary policymakers in that era, the threat of high inflation felt proximate, the hard-fought battle to control high inflation having been just recently won. technological progress seemed likely to continue to sustain rapid increases in productivity—an outcome we continue to await. and the effective lower bound for interest rates was mainly a theoretical concern, except of course in japan. the changes to the macroeconomic environment may have been in train earlier, but the crisis seems to have accelerated the process. the world in which policymakers are now operating is discretely different in important ways from the one before the great recession.    i should also note, as is fitting given this event and this audience, that since the crisis policymakers are even more keenly aware of the relevance of global factors to our policies. the global nature of the financial crisis and the channels through which it spread sharply highlight the interconnectedness of our economic, financial, and policy environments. u.s. economic developments affect the rest of the world, and the reverse is also true. for example, the stresses surrounding the euro crisis and, later, the china-related volatility events in 2015 and 2016 led to a general pullback in demand for risky assets that put downward pressure on u.s. interest rates and weighed on u.s. confidence and growth. in addition, we have seen how monetary policy in one country can influence economic and financial conditions in others through financial markets, trade, and confidence channels. pursuing our domestic mandates in this new world requires that we understand the anticipated effects of these interconnections and incorporate them into our policy decisionmaking.    a second important feature of this new world is the tools central bankers now have to fight recessions. in the face of the dramatic economic and financial collapse during the crisis, policymakers quickly exhausted conventional monetary policy tools and employed a range of unconventional measures to support their economies.    in the united states, these measures included new forms of forward guidance and a range of balance sheet policies. broadly across different economies, so-called unconventional monetary policies have generally been successful at lowering interest rates and supporting economic recovery, though cyclical and structural headwinds have made achieving our inflation targets a challenge. a legacy of the crisis is that policymakers now have a broader range of tested tools to turn to the next time the effective lower bound is reached. we must continue to assess additional strategies and tools to bolster our economies and meet our inflation and employment mandates.    finally, the crisis and great recession brought into stark relief the need for transparency and accountability for central banks. central bank communication is increasingly important and increasingly challenging. it is important because clear, transparent communication about the economy, the risks, and our policy responses is critical for the effectiveness of our tools and for our accountability to the public in a democratic society.    it is challenging, because we are operating in a changing macroeconomic environment with tools that, while no longer new, remain less familiar to the public. moreover, our audience has become more varied, more attuned to our actions, and less trusting of public institutions. gone are the days when the federal reserve chair could joke, as my predecessor alan greenspan did, ""if i turn out to be particularly clear, you've probably misunderstood what i said."" 1 central banks must speak to main street, as well as wall street, in ways we have not in the past, and main street is listening and engaged.    where does this leave us, and how should policymakers adapt to this new environment? recognizing challenges posed by the changing structure of the economy, the need for effective policy responses, and the importance of clear communication, central banks are taking a closer look at their strategies and the range of tools currently at their disposal. for example, the bank of canada examines its framework every five years as part of the renewal of its inflation-control agreement with the federal government. canadian officials have announced the bank will ""assess a broad range of monetary policy frameworks ahead of the renewal in 2021"" of this agreement.2 the bank of england commissioned a review over the past year of the future of the united kingdom's financial system and what it might mean for the bank's agenda, toolkit, and capabilities.3 for our part, the federal reserve is conducting, for the first time, a public review of the strategy, tools, and communications that we use to promote our goals of maximum employment and price stability.4 the heart of this review has been a series of fed listens events around the country, in every reserve bank district, to hear directly from the constituencies we serve. these events have been live-streamed on the internet. last month, we hosted a research conference at the federal reserve bank of chicago to explore ways to more effectively and sustainably achieve our mandated goals. beginning soon, the fomc will devote time at its regular meetings to assessing the lessons from these events. we will publicly report the conclusions of our discussions, likely during the first half of next year.5    other central banks, many represented in this room, are also looking deeply at the challenges posed by the current environment and assessing tools and strategies. i look forward to learning from your experiences and sharing ours in the coming months and years as we face the trials and opportunities of this new era.    for all of us, the turmoil that preceded this new world was severe, although not as extreme as that faced by those around the table in bretton woods 75 years ago. tonight let us celebrate their success and strive so that our vision for the future of the global economic and financial system proves as durable and as effective."
2019-08-23,2847.11,"Chair_Powell_2019-Aug-23",-2.59463897774508,"this year's symposium topic is ""challenges for monetary policy,"" and for the federal reserve those challenges flow from our mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability. from this perspective, our economy is now in a favorable place, and i will describe how we are working to sustain these conditions in the face of significant risks we have been monitoring.    the current u.s. expansion has entered its 11th year and is now the longest on record.1 the unemployment rate has fallen steadily throughout the expansion and has been near half-century lows since early 2018. but that rate alone does not fully capture the benefits of this historically strong job market. labor force participation by people in their prime working years has been rising. while unemployment for minorities generally remains higher than for the workforce as a whole, the rate for african americans, at 6 percent, is the lowest since the government began tracking it in 1972. for the past few years, wages have been increasing the most for people at the lower end of the wage scale. people who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job market is the best anyone can recall. we increasingly hear reports that employers are training workers who lack required skills, adapting jobs to the needs of employees with family responsibilities, and offering second chances to people who need one.    inflation has been surprisingly stable during the expansion: not falling much when the economy was weak and not rising much as the expansion gained strength. inflation ran close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year but has been running somewhat below 2 percent this year.    thus, after a decade of progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the economy is close to both goals. our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 2 percent.    today i will explore what history tells us about sustaining long, steady expansions. a good place to start is with the passage of the employment act of 1946, which stated that it is the ""continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government ... to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.""2 some version of these goals has been in place ever since. i will divide the history since world war ii into three eras organized around some well-known ""greats."" the first era comprises the postwar years through the great inflation. the second era brought the great moderation but ended in the great recession. the third era is still under way, and time will tell what ""greats"" may emerge.    each era presents a key question for the fed and for society more generally. the first era raises the question whether a central bank can resist the temptations that led to the great inflation. the second era raises the question whether long expansions supported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses like those seen in the great moderation. the third era confronts us with the question of how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. near the end of my remarks, i will discuss the current context, and the ways these questions are shaping policy.    era i, 1950–1982: policy breeds macroeconomic instability and the great inflation  the late 1940s were a period of adjustment to a peacetime economy. as the 1940s turned to the 1950s, the state of knowledge about how best to promote macroeconomic stability was limited. the 1950s and early 1960s saw the economy oscillating sharply between recession and growth above 6 percent (figure 1, panel a). three expansions and contractions came in quick succession. with the benefit of hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to ""stop and go"" stabilization policy, as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their blunt but powerful tools.3    beginning in the mid-1960s, ""stop and go"" policy gave way to ""too much go and not enough stop""—not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures. both inflation and inflation expectations ratcheted upward through four expansions until the fed, under chairman paul volcker, engineered a definitive stop in the early 1980s (figure 1, panel c). each of the expansions in the great inflation period ended with monetary policy tightening in response to rising inflation.    policymakers came out of the great inflation era with a clear understanding that it was essential to anchor inflation expectations at some low level. but many believed that central bankers would find it difficult to ignore the temptation of short-term employment gains at the cost of higher inflation down the road.4    era ii, 1983 through 2009: the great moderation and great recession  as the second era began, inflation was falling, and it continued to fall for about a decade (figure 2, panel c). in 1993, core inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, first fell below 2.5 percent, and has since remained in the narrow range of 0.9 percent to 2.5 percent.5 greater success on price stability came with greater success on employment. expansions in this era were longer and more stable than before (figure 2, panel a). the era saw two of the three longest u.s. expansions up to that point in history.6    anchored inflation expectations helped make this win-win outcome possible, by giving the fed latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation. the fed was cutting, not raising, rates in the months prior to the end of the first two expansions in this era, and the ensuing recessions were mild by historical standards. and twice during the long expansion of the 1990s, the federal open market committee (fomc) eased policy in response to threats to growth. in 1995, responding to evidence of slowing in the united states and abroad, the fomc reduced the federal funds rate over a few months. in 1998, the russian debt default and the related collapse of the hedge fund long‑term capital management rocked financial markets that were already fragile from the asian financial crisis. given the risks posed to the u.s. economy, the fomc again lowered the federal funds rate over a period of months until events quieted. the 10-year expansion weathered both events with no discernible inflation cost.7    by the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and global events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than overheating and rising inflation. the collapse of the tech stock bubble in 2000 and the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks played key roles in precipitating a slowdown that turned into a recession.8 and the next expansion, as we are all painfully aware, ended with the collapse of a housing bubble and the global financial crisis. thus, this second era provided good reason for optimism about the fed's ability to deliver stable inflation, but also raised a question about whether long expansions inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses.    era iii, 2010 and after: monetary policy and the emerging new normal  the third era began in 2010 as the recovery from the great recession was taking hold. my focus in discussing this era will be on a ""new normal"" that is becoming apparent in the wake of the crisis. i will fast-forward past the early years of the expansion and pick up the story in december 2015.9 the unemployment rate had fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 5 percent, roughly equal to the median fomc participant's estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at the time. at this point, the committee decided that it was prudent to begin gradually raising the federal funds rate based on the closely monitored premise that the increasingly healthy economy called for more-normal interest rates. the premise was generally borne out: growth from the end of 2015 to the end of 2018 averaged 2.5 percent, a bit above the 2.2 percent rate over the previous five years (figure 2, panel a). the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent, and inflation moved up and remained close to our 2 percent objective through much of 2018 (figure 2, panels b and c).    that brings us to 2019. before turning to issues occupying center stage at present, i want to address a long-running issue that i discussed here last year: tracking the ""stars"" that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.10 these include u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and r*, the neutral real rate of interest. unlike celestial stars, these stars move unpredictably and cannot be directly observed. we must judge their locations as best we can based on incoming data and then add an element of risk management to be able to use them as guides.    since 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation, prompting a steady decline in estimates of u* (figure 3).11 standard estimates of r* have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades. some argue that the effective decline is even larger.12 incorporating a lower value of u* into policymaking does not require a significant change in our approach. the significant fall in r*, however, may demand more fundamental change. a lower r* combined with low inflation means that interest rates will run, on average, significantly closer to their effective lower bound.    the key question raised by this era, then, is how we can best support maximum employment and price stability in a world with a low neutral interest rate.    current policy and the three key questions  let me turn now to the current implications for monetary policy of the questions raised by these three eras. the first era raised the question of whether the fed can avoid excessive inflation. inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and low inflation has been the main concern for the past decade. low inflation seems to be the problem of this era, not high inflation. nonetheless, in the unlikely event that signs of too-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation.    the second era's question—whether long expansions inevitably breed financial excesses—is a challenging and timely one. hyman minsky long argued that, as an expansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk management deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.13 this observation has spurred much discussion. at the end of the day, we cannot prevent people from finding ways to take excessive financial risks. but we can work to make sure that they bear the costs of their decisions, and that the financial system as a whole continues to function effectively. since the crisis, congress, the fed, and other regulatory authorities here and around the world have taken substantial steps to achieve these goals. banks and other key institutions have significantly more capital and more stable funding than before the crisis. we comprehensively review financial stability every quarter and release our assessments twice a year to highlight areas of concern and allow oversight of our efforts. we have not seen unsustainable borrowing, financial booms, or other excesses of the sort that occurred at times during the great moderation, and i continue to judge overall financial stability risks to be moderate. but we remain vigilant.    that leaves the third question of how, in this low r* world, the fed can best support the economy. a low neutral interest rate presents both near-term and longer-term challenges. i will begin with the current context. because today's setting is both challenging and unique in many ways, it may be useful to lay out some general principles for assessing and implementing appropriate policy and to describe how we have been applying those principles.    through the fomc's setting of the federal funds rate target range and our communications about the likely path forward for policy and the economy, we seek to influence broader financial conditions to promote maximum employment and price stability. in forming judgments about the appropriate stance of policy, the committee digests a broad range of data and other information to assess the current state of the economy, the most likely outlook for the future, and meaningful risks to that outlook. because the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a year or more, the committee must attempt to look through what may be passing developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so. risk management enters our decisionmaking because of both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face regarding structural aspects of the economy, including the natural rate of unemployment and the neutral rate of interest. it will at times be appropriate for us to tilt policy one way or the other because of prominent risks. finally, we have a responsibility to explain what we are doing and why we are doing it so the american people and their elected representatives in congress can provide oversight and hold us accountable.    we have much experience in addressing typical macroeconomic developments under this framework. but fitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new challenge. setting trade policy is the business of congress and the administration, not that of the fed. our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals. in principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy. there are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation. moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade. we can, however, try to look through what may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook, and adjust policy to promote our objectives.    this approach is illustrated by the way incoming data have shaped the likely path of policy this year. the outlook for the u.s. economy since the start of the year has continued to be a favorable one. business investment and manufacturing have weakened, but solid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and supporting moderate growth overall.    as the year has progressed, we have been monitoring three factors that are weighing on this favorable outlook: slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation. the global growth outlook has been deteriorating since the middle of last year. trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the united states. inflation fell below our objective at the start of the year. it appears to be moving back up closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective, but there are concerns about a more prolonged shortfall.    committee participants have generally reacted to these developments and the risks they pose by shifting down their projections of the appropriate federal funds rate path. along with july's rate cut, the shifts in the anticipated path of policy have eased financial conditions and help explain why the outlook for inflation and employment remains largely favorable.    turning to the current context, we are carefully watching developments as we assess their implications for the u.s. outlook and the path of monetary policy. the three weeks since our july fomc meeting have been eventful, beginning with the announcement of new tariffs on imports from china. we have seen further evidence of a global slowdown, notably in germany and china. geopolitical events have been much in the news, including the growing possibility of a hard brexit, rising tensions in hong kong, and the dissolution of the italian government. financial markets have reacted strongly to this complex, turbulent picture. equity markets have been volatile. long-term bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post-crisis lows. meanwhile, the u.s. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer spending. job creation has slowed from last year's pace but is still above overall labor force growth. inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent. based on our assessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.    the three questions in the longer run  looking back over the three eras, monetary policy has evolved to address new challenges as they have arisen. the inflation targeting regime that emerged after the great inflation has led to vastly improved outcomes for employment and price stability around the world. one result has been much longer expansions, which often brought with them the buildup of financial risk. this new pattern has led us to understand that assuring financial stability over time requires much greater resilience in our financial system, particularly for our largest, most complex banks.    as we look back over the decade since the end of the financial crisis, we can again see fundamental economic changes that call for a reassessment of our policy framework. the current era has been characterized by much lower neutral interest rates, disinflationary pressures, and slower growth. we face heightened risks of lengthy, difficult-to-escape periods in which our policy interest rate is pinned near zero. to address this new normal, we are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the first of its kind for the federal reserve. we are evaluating the pros and cons of strategies that aim to reverse past misses of our inflation objective. we are examining the monetary policy tools we have used both in calm times and in crisis, and we are asking whether we should expand our toolkit. in addition, we are looking at how we might improve the communication of our policy framework.    public engagement, unprecedented in scope for the fed, is at the heart of this effort. through fed listens events live-streamed on the internet, we are hearing a diverse range of perspectives not only from academic experts, but also from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. we have begun a series of fomc meetings at which we will discuss these questions. we will continue reporting on our discussions in the fomc minutes and share our conclusions when we finish the review next year.    i will conclude by saying that we are deeply committed to fulfilling our mandate in this challenging era, and i look forward to the valuable insights that will, i am confident, be shared at this symposium."
2019-10-04,2952.01,"Chair_Powell_2019-Oct-4",1.42168533960002,"good afternoon. welcome to the room where members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 reserve banks meet eight times a year—most recently, two weeks ago—to decide the stance of monetary policy. it's a magnificent, formal—perhaps even imposing—room, with 26-foot ceilings, a monumental marble fireplace, and a 1,000-pound brass and glass chandelier. it's seen a lot of history since franklin roosevelt dedicated this building in 1937. british and american military leaders conferred here during world war ii. and, through the decades, our federal reserve predecessors grappled with financial turmoil and the economy's ups and downs. so when my colleagues and i take our assigned places around this polished mahogany and granite table, the setting and its history lends a certain formality—dare i say, stuffiness—to the proceedings.    as we kick off this 12th of 14 fed listens events, governor brainard, governor bowman, and i hope that today's meeting is anything but stuffy. candid and serious, yes. but not stuffy. the reserve banks and the board have been holding fed listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. almost all of the fed listens meetings, like this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet. both the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.    one reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for any organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more effectively. but we must pose that question not just to ourselves. because congress has granted the federal reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures, we have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. and we have an obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected representatives can hold us accountable.    we've invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary policy affects the lives of the people your organizations represent—union members, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others. we want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stability—the monetary policy goals congress has assigned us.    now is a good time to conduct the review. unemployment is near a half-century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective. while not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall it is—as i like to say—in a good place. our job is to keep it there as long as possible. while we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the u.s. economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term challenges—from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. while slow growth is obviously not good, you may be asking, ""what's wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?"" low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest rates—are too low, the fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support the economy during downturns.    so, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies. more-firmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. we are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next downturn comes. finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.    after today, we have two fed listens sessions remaining, both later this month: one in kansas city and another in chicago. at the july meeting of the federal open market committee, my colleagues and i began discussing what we've learned so far from the fed listens events. we continued that discussion at our september meeting and have a lot left to do. we plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year.    one clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining our historically strong job market. people from low- and moderate-income communities tell us this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a degree that has not been felt for many years. employers are partnering with community colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training. and people who have struggled to stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.    once again, welcome. now it is your turn to speak. we're listening."
2019-10-07,2938.79,"Chair_Powell_2019-Oct-7",-0.447830461278934,"thank you, randy, for the kind introduction. it is a great pleasure to join you all this morning for the premiere of kued's documentary marriner eccles: father of the modern federal reserve. it is also a great pleasure to be in utah. it has been a long time since a fed chair made an official visit to utah. alan greenspan spoke in salt lake city 22 years ago. all of the utahns here know about the eccles family's enormous contributions to building the economies of the state and the region. the documentary will remind us of marriner's immense contribution not just to the region, but also to our nation during the great depression, world war ii, and thereafter.    many eccles family members are present here today. i would like to especially recognize marriner's grandson, chip eccles; marriner's nephew, spencer eccles; and spencer's daughter, hope eccles. randy was fortunate to marry hope, and he has a second federal reserve connection. he is our vice chair for supervision.    in a way, i feel that i know marriner, too. i work in a building named after him. i sit in the office where he sat as chair. and his portrait hangs in a room where i frequently meet with guests, board colleagues, and staff. when i sit in my usual seat, he stands, looking over my left shoulder, an enigmatic expression—neither approving nor disapproving—on his face. talk about pressure!    more seriously, his legacy endures in much more than a name on a building and a portrait on a wall. as the depression deepened, he presciently recognized that the federal government should act forcefully to put people back to work and stimulate business. in a speech delivered here in utah in 1932, marriner asked what was the purpose of an economic system if not to allow those willing and able to work the opportunity to do so, to ""guarantee to them sustenance for their families and protection against want and destitution.""1 his ideas helped form the basis of franklin d. roosevelt's new deal and anticipated the not-yet-published tenets of british economist john maynard keynes. after world war ii, he recognized, again presciently, that high inflation, not contraction, posed the principal threat to the u.s. economy.    and, perhaps most importantly from my perspective as fed chair, he is responsible more than any other person for the fact that the united states today has an independent central bank—a central bank able to make decisions in the long-term best interest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment. during his years on the fed board, marriner played a crucial role in two landmark accomplishments that established the modern federal reserve—the banking act of 1935, near the start of his tenure at the fed, and the federal reserve-treasury accord of 1951, at the end.    fdr nominated marriner to lead the fed board in 1934. he accepted on the condition that roosevelt support a restructuring of the fed, which had failed to counter the contraction gripping the nation's economy. the result was the banking act of 1935, which significantly strengthened the structural independence of the federal reserve. and, symbolically important, it authorized the board to move its meetings from the treasury department to a new building—the building that now bears marriner's name—on constitution avenue, across from the lincoln memorial.    during world war ii, the fed effectively ceded control of monetary policy to the treasury department by agreeing to maintain a low interest rate peg on government bonds. the low rates helped the government finance the war, but after the war ended, inflation soared. it subsided for a time but, with the korean war, spiked again. in 1951, marriner led other board members in precipitating a clean break with the peg arrangement, laying the foundation for the modern fed. the federal reserve-treasury accord of that year separated government debt management from monetary policy and freed the fed to combat high inflation and set short-term interest rates based on what was best for the economy.    those are just the highlights of marriner's fed career. you will learn much more in the film we are about to see. in closing, i leave you with this statement from marriner, inscribed on a plaque in the eccles building: ""the management of the central bank must be absolutely free from the dangers of control by politics and by private interests, singly or combined."""
2019-10-08,2893.06,"Chair_Powell_2019-Oct-8",-1.55608260542604,"thank you for this opportunity to speak at the 61st annual meeting of the national association for business economics.    at the fed, we like to say that monetary policy is data dependent. we say this to emphasize that policy is never on a preset course and will change as appropriate in response to incoming information. but that does not capture the breadth and depth of what data-dependent decisionmaking means to us. from its beginnings more than a century ago, the federal reserve has gone to great lengths to collect and rigorously analyze the best information to make sound decisions for the public we serve.    the topic of this meeting, ""trucks and terabytes: integrating the 'new' and 'old' economies,"" captures the essence of a major challenge for data-dependent policymaking. we must sort out in real time, as best we can, what the profound changes underway in the economy mean for issues such as the functioning of labor markets, the pace of productivity growth, and the forces driving inflation.    of course, issues like these have always been with us. indeed, 100 years ago, some of the first fed policymakers recognized the need for more timely information on the rapidly evolving state of industry and decided to create and publish production indexes for the united states. today i will pay tribute to the 100 years of dedicated—and often behind the scenes—work of those tracking change in the industrial landscape.    i will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: first, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the u.s. economy? this question, which never seems far from relevance, is again drawing our attention after recent events in the persian gulf. while the question is familiar, technological advances in the energy sector are rapidly changing our assessment of the answer.    second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity? put more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an artifact of antiquated measurement?    third, how tight is the labor market? given our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work. but answering it in real time in a dynamic economy as jobs are gained in one area but lost in others is remarkably challenging. in august, the bureau of labor statistics (bls) announced that job gains over the year through march were likely a half-million lower than previously reported. i will discuss how we are using big data to improve our grasp of the job market in the face of such revisions.    these three quite varied questions highlight the broad range of issues that currently come under the simple heading ""data dependent."" after exploring them, i will comment briefly on recent developments in money markets and on monetary policy.    a century of industrial production  our story of data dependence in the face of change begins when the fed opened for business in 1914. world war i was breaking out in europe, and over the next four years the war would fuel profound growth and transformation in the u.s. economy.1 but you could not have seen this change in the gross national product data; the department of commerce did not publish those until 1942. the census bureau had been running a census of manufactures since 1905, but that came only every five years—an eternity in the rapidly changing economy. in need of more timely information, the fed began creating and publishing a series of industrial output reports that soon evolved into industrial production indexes.2 the indexes initially comprised 22 basic commodities, chosen in part because they covered the major industrial groups, but also for the practical reason that data were available with less than a one-month lag. the fed's efforts were among the earliest in creating timely measures of aggregate production. over the century of its existence, our industrial production team has remained at the frontier of economic measurement, using the most advanced techniques to monitor u.s. industry and nimbly track changes in production.    what are the consequences of an oil price spike?  let's turn now to the first question of the consequences of an oil price spike. figure 1 shows u.s. oil production since 1920. after rising fairly steadily through the early 1970s, production began a long period of gradual decline. by 2005, production was at about the same level as it had been 50 years earlier. since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3 in 2018, the united states became the world's largest oil producer.4 oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the u.s. energy information administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the united states will be a net exporter of oil.5    as monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several u.s. recessions and in the great inflation of the 1960s and 1970s. traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and, hence, on the u.s. economy. today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the u.s. oil industry. moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions. thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly offsetting effects on u.s. gross domestic product (gdp).    how should we measure output and productivity?  let's now turn to the second question of how to best measure output and productivity. while there are some subtleties in measuring oil output, we know how to count barrels of oil. measuring the overall level of goods and services produced in the economy is fundamentally messier, because it requires adding apples and oranges—and automobiles and myriad other goods and services. the hard-working statisticians creating the official statistics regularly adapt the data sources and methods so that, insofar as possible, the measured data provide accurate indicators of the state of the economy. periods of rapid change present particular challenges, and it can take time for the measurement system to adapt to fully and accurately reflect the changes in the economy.    the advance of technology has long presented measurement challenges. in 1987, nobel prize–winning economist robert solow quipped that ""you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.""6 in the second half of the 1990s, this measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7 chairman alan greenspan famously argued that the united states was experiencing the dawn of a new economy, and that potential and actual output were likely understated in official statistics. where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures. in light of the uncertainty it faced, the federal open market committee (fomc) judged that the appropriate risk‑management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation. under this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later revisions to gdp measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8    this episode illustrates a key challenge to making data-dependent policy in real time: good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like. sound decisionmaking therefore requires the application of good judgment and a healthy dose of risk management.    productivity is again presenting a puzzle. official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: first, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more‑normal levels after a brief golden age.10 second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 at this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved. as in the late 1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains. moreover, productivity growth seems to have moved up over the past year after a long period at very low levels; we do not know whether that welcome trend will be sustained.    recent research suggests that current official statistics may understate productivity growth by missing a significant part of the growing value we derive from fast internet connections and smartphones. these technologies, which were just emerging 15 years ago, are now ubiquitous (figure 3). we can now be constantly connected to the accumulated knowledge of humankind and receive near instantaneous updates on the lives of friends far and wide. and, adding to the measurement challenge, many of these services are free, which is to say, not explicitly priced. how should we value the luxury of never needing to ask for directions? or the peace and tranquility afforded by speedy resolution of those contentious arguments over the trivia of the moment?    researchers have tried to answer these questions in various ways.13 for example, fed researchers have recently proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of services consumers derive from cellphones and other devices based on the volume of data flowing over those connections.14 taking their accounting at face value, gdp growth would have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable change and would be very good news. growth over the previous couple of decades would also have been about 1/4 percentage point higher as well, implying that measurement issues of this sort likely account for only part of the productivity slowdown in current statistics. research in this area is at an early stage, but this example illustrates the depth of analysis supporting our data-dependent decisionmaking.    how tight is the labor market?  let me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an issue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking: how tight is the labor market? answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. while this topic is always front and center in our thinking, i am raising it today to illustrate how we are using big data to inform policymaking.    until recently, the official data showed job gains over the year through march 2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant. in august, the bls publicly previewed the benchmark data revision coming in february 2020, and the news was that job gains over this period were more like 170,000 per month—a meaningfully lower number that itself remains subject to revision. the pace of job gains is hard to pin down in real time largely because of the dynamism of our economy: many new businesses open and others close every month, creating some jobs and ending others, and definitive data on this turnover arrive with a substantial lag. thus, initial data are, in part, sophisticated guesses based on what is known as the birth–death model of firms.    several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm adp to construct a measure of payroll employment from their data set, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one-week delay.15 as described in a recent research paper, we constructed a measure that provides an independent read on payroll employment that complements the official statistics.16 while experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising evidence that it can refine our real-time picture of job gains. for example, in the first eight months of 2008, as the great recession was getting underway, the official monthly employment data showed total job losses of about 750,000 (figure 4). a later benchmark revision told a much bleaker story, with declines of about 1.5 million. our new measure, had it been available in 2008, would have been much closer to the revised data, alerting us that the job situation might be considerably worse than the official data suggested.17    we believe that the new measure may help us better understand job market conditions in real time. the preview of the bls benchmark revision leaves average job gains over the year through march solidly above the pace required to accommodate growth in the workforce over that time, but where we had seen a booming job market, we now see more-moderate growth. the benchmark revision will not directly affect data for job gains since march, but experience with past revisions suggests that some part of the benchmark will likely carry forward. thus, the currently reported job gains of 157,000 per month on average over the past three months may well be revised somewhat lower. based on a range of data and analysis, including our new measure, we now judge that, even allowing for such a revision, job gains remain above the level required to provide jobs for new entrants to the jobs market over time. of course, the pace of job gains is only one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy is performing relative to our maximum-employment mandate and our assessment of any inflationary pressures arising in the job market.    what does data dependence mean at present?  in summary, data dependence is, and always has been, at the heart of policymaking at the federal reserve. we are always seeking out new and better sources of information and refining our analysis of that information to keep us abreast of conditions as our economy constantly reinvents itself. before wrapping up, i will discuss recent developments in money markets and the current stance of monetary policy.    our influence on the financial conditions that affect employment and inflation is indirect. the federal reserve sets two overnight interest rates: the interest rate paid on banks' reserve balances and the rate on our reverse repurchase agreements. we use these two administered rates to keep a market-determined rate, the federal funds rate, within a target range set by the fomc. we rely on financial markets to transmit these rates through a variety of channels to the rates paid by households and businesses—and to financial conditions more broadly.    in mid-september, an important channel in the transmission process—wholesale funding markets—exhibited unexpectedly intense volatility. payments to meet corporate tax obligations and to purchase treasury securities triggered notable liquidity pressures in money markets. overnight interest rates spiked, and the effective federal funds rate briefly moved above the fomc's target range. to counter these pressures, we began conducting temporary open market operations. these operations have kept the federal funds rate in the target range and alleviated money market strains more generally.    while a range of factors may have contributed to these developments, it is clear that without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banking system, even routine increases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest rates. this volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it. indeed, my colleagues and i will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time. consistent with a decision we made in january, our goal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered rates and not through frequent market interventions. of course, we will not hesitate to conduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range.    reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the federal reserve's balance sheet, and demand for these liabilities—notably, currency in circulation—grows over time. hence, increasing the supply of reserves or even maintaining a given level over time requires us to increase the size of our balance sheet. as we indicated in our march statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point, we will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of reserves.18 that time is now upon us.    i want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis. neither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy, to which i now turn.    our goal in monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and stable prices, which we interpret as inflation running closely around our symmetric 2 percent objective. at present, the jobs and inflation pictures are favorable. many indicators show a historically strong labor market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at half-century lows, and rising prime-age labor force participation. wages are rising, especially for those with lower-paying jobs. inflation is somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective but has been gradually firming over the past few months. fomc participants continue to see a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely. many outside forecasters agree.    but there are risks to this favorable outlook, principally from global developments. growth around much of the world has weakened over the past year and a half, and uncertainties around trade, brexit, and other issues pose risks to the outlook. as those factors have evolved, my colleagues and i have shifted our views about appropriate monetary policy toward a lower path for the federal funds rate and have lowered its target range by 50 basis points. we believe that our policy actions are providing support for the outlook. looking ahead, policy is not on a preset course. the next fomc meeting is several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information. we will be data dependent, assessing the outlook and risks to the outlook on a meeting-by-meeting basis. taking all that into account, we will act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 percent objective."
2019-10-09,2919.4,"Chair_Powell_2019-Oct-9",0.910454674289512,"good morning. i am happy to be here in kansas city for the 13th of 14 fed listens events. i look forward to hearing the perspectives of the community and business leaders participating today.    the reserve banks and the board have been holding fed listens events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. almost all of the fed listens meetings, like this one, have been open to the press and live-streamed on the internet. both the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.    one reason we are conducting this review is that it is always a good practice for any organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more effectively. but we must pose that question not just to ourselves. because congress has granted the federal reserve significant protections from short-term political pressures, we have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why. and we have an obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected representatives can hold us accountable. we have invited you here because we want to better understand how monetary policy affects your lives and the lives of the people your organizations represent. we want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and price stability—the monetary policy goals congress has assigned us.    now is a good time to conduct the review. unemployment is at a half-century low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective. while not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall, it is—as i like to say—in a good place. our job is to keep it there as long as possible. while we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the u.s. economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer-term challenges—from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. while slow growth is obviously not good, you may be asking, ""what's wrong with low inflation and low interest rates?"" low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest rates—are too low, the fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support the economy during downturns.    so, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow us to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation. doing so would help prevent inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, as they appear to have done in several advanced economies. more-firmly anchored expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate. we are also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools will be adequate when the next downturn comes. finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.    after today, we have one fed listens session remaining, later this month in chicago. at the july meeting of the federal open market committee, my colleagues and i began discussing what we have learned so far from the fed listens events. we continued that discussion at our september meeting and have a lot left to do. we plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year.    one clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining this historically strong job market. people from low- and moderate-income communities tell us that this long recovery, now in its 11th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a degree that has not been felt for many years. employers are partnering with community colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training. and people who have struggled to stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.    once again, i'm happy to be here. now it is your turn to speak. we're listening."
2019-11-25,3133.64,"Chair_Powell_2019-Nov-25",0.750733854399426,"over the past year, my colleagues and i on the federal open market committee (fomc) have been conducting a first-ever public review of how we make monetary policy. as part of that review, we held fed listens events around the country where representatives from a wide range of groups have been telling us how the economy is working for them and the people they represent and how the federal reserve might better promote the goals congress has set for us: maximum employment and price stability. we have heard two messages loud and clear. first, as this expansion continues into its 11th year—the longest in u.s. history—economic conditions are generally good. second, the benefits of the long expansion are only now reaching many communities, and there is plenty of room to build on the impressive gains achieved so far.    these themes show through in many ways in official statistics. for example, more than a decade of steady advances has pushed the jobless rate near a 50-year low, where it has remained for well over a year. but the wealth of middle-income families—savings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before the great recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has yet to fully recover.1    fortunately, the outlook for further progress is good: forecasters are generally predicting continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation near 2 percent. tonight i will begin by discussing the fed's policy actions over the past year to support the favorable outlook. then i will turn to two important opportunities for further gains from this expansion: maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and spreading the benefits of employment more widely.    monetary policy and the economy in 2019  we started 2019 with a favorable outlook, and over the year the outlook has changed only modestly in the eyes of many forecasters (figure 1). for example, in the survey of professional forecasters, the forecast for inflation is a bit lower, but the unemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (gdp) is nearly unchanged.2 the key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending, which represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported by the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.    while events of the year have not much changed the outlook, the process of getting from there to here has been far from dull. i will describe how we grappled with incoming information and made important monetary policy changes through the year to help keep the favorable outlook on track.    as the year began, growth appeared robust, but the economy faced some risks flowing mainly from weakening global economic growth and trade developments. foreign growth, which slipped in the second half of last year, slid further as 2019 progressed. while weaker foreign growth does not necessarily translate into similar weakness here, it does hurt our exporters and presents a risk that the weakness may spread more broadly. at the same time, business contacts around the country have been telling us that trade-related uncertainties are weighing on their decisions. these global developments have been holding back overall economic growth. manufacturing output, which had only recently surpassed its level before the great recession, has declined this year and is again below its pre-recession peak. business investment has also weakened.    in addition, inflation pressures proved unexpectedly muted this year. after remaining close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for much of last year, inflation is now running below 2 percent. some of the softness in overall inflation is the result of a fall in oil prices and should not affect inflation going forward. but core inflation—which omits volatile food and energy prices—is also running somewhat below 2 percent.    the main themes of our deliberations this year have been a continuing favorable outlook founded on strength in the household sector, with a few yellow flags including muted inflation and weakness in manufacturing. in addition, global growth and trade have presented ongoing risks and uncertainties. we also faced some less prominent factors that always confront policymakers. specifically, we never have a crystal clear real-time picture of how the economy is performing. in addition, the precise timing and size of the effects of our policy decisions cannot be known in real time.    in august, the bureau of labor statistics previewed a likely revision to its count of payroll job creation for the 12 months ended march 2019. the preview indicated that job gains over that period were about half a million lower than previously reported. on a monthly basis, job gains were likely about 170,000 per month, rather than 210,000. while this news did not dramatically alter our outlook, it pointed to an economy with somewhat less momentum than we had thought.3    uncertainty about how our policies are affecting the economy also entered our discussions. as you know, we set our policy interest rate to achieve our goals of maximum employment and stable prices. in doing so, we often refer to certain benchmarks. one of these is the interest rate that would be neutral—neither restraining the economy nor pushing it upward. we call that rate ""r*"" (pronounced ""r star""). a policy rate above r* would tend to restrain economic activity, while a setting below r* would tend to speed up the economy. a second benchmark is the natural rate of unemployment, which is the lowest rate of unemployment that would not create upward pressure on inflation. we call that rate ""u*"" (pronounced ""u star""). you can think of r* and u* as two of the main stars by which we navigate. in an ideal world, policymakers could rely on these stars like mariners before the advent of gps. but, unlike celestial stars on a clear night, we cannot directly observe these stars, and their values change in ways that are difficult to track in real time. standard estimates of r* and u* made by policymakers and other analysts have been falling since 2012 (figure 2). since the end of last year, incoming data—especially muted inflation data—prompted analysts inside and outside the fed to again revise down their estimates of r* and u*.4 taken at face value, a lower r* would suggest that monetary policy is providing somewhat less support for employment and inflation than previously believed, and the fall in u* would suggest that the labor market was less tight than believed.5 both could help explain the weakness in inflation. as with the revised jobs data, these revised estimates of the stars were not a game changer for policy, but they provided another reason why a somewhat lower setting of our policy interest rate might be appropriate.    how did we add up all of these considerations? to help keep the u.s. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks, we progressively eased the stance of monetary policy over the course of the year. first, we signaled that increases in our short-term interest rate were unlikely. then, from july to october, we reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 3/4 percentage point. the full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time, but we believe they are already helping to support consumer and business sentiment and boosting spending in interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and consumer durable goods.    we see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. policy is not on a preset course.    i will wrap up with two areas where we have an opportunity to build on our gains.    a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent  for many years as the economy recovered from the great recession, inflation averaged around 1.5 percent—below our 2 percent objective (figure 3). we had long expected that inflation would gradually rise as the expansion continued, and, as i noted, both overall and core inflation ran at rates consistent with our goal for much of 2018. but this year, inflation is again running below 2 percent.    it is reasonable to ask why inflation running somewhat below 2 percent is a big deal. we have heard a lot about inflation at our fed listens events. people are concerned about the rising cost of medical care, of housing, and of college, but nobody seems to be complaining about overall inflation running below 2 percent. even central bankers are not concerned about any particular minor fluctuation in inflation.    around the world, however, we have seen that inflation running persistently below target can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation further down. lower inflation can, in turn, pull interest rates to ever-lower levels. the experience of japan, and now the euro area, suggests that this dynamic is very difficult to reverse, and once under way, it can make it harder for a central bank to support its economy by further lowering interest rates. that is why it is essential that we at the fed use our tools to make sure that we do not permit an unhealthy downward drift in inflation expectations and inflation. we are strongly committed to symmetrically and sustainably achieving our 2 percent inflation objective so that in making long-term plans, households and businesses can reasonably expect 2 percent inflation over time.    spreading the benefits of employment  many people at our fed listens events have told us that this long expansion is now benefiting low- and middle-income communities to a degree that has not been felt for many years. we have heard about companies, communities, and schools working together to help employees build skills—and of employers working creatively to structure jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life beyond the workplace. we have heard that many people who in the past struggled to stay in the workforce are now working and adding new and better chapters to their lives. these stories show clearly in the job market data. employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among people with disabilities (figure 4).    the strong labor market is also encouraging more people in their prime working years—ages 25 to 54—to rejoin or remain in the labor force, meaning that they either have a job or are actively looking for one. this is a welcome development. for several decades up until the mid-1990s, the share of prime-age people in the labor force rose, as an influx of women more than offset some decline in male participation. in the mid-1990s, however, prime-age participation began to fall, and the drop-off became steeper in the great recession and the early years of the recovery (figure 5). between 2007 and 2013, falling participation by both men and women contributed to a 2 percentage point overall decline. our falling participation rate stands out among advanced economies. while the united states was roughly in the middle of the pack among 32 economies as of 1995, in 2018 we ranked near the bottom (figure 6). fortunately, in the strong job market since 2014, prime-age participation has been staging a comeback. so far, we have made up more than half the loss in the great recession, which translates to almost 2 million more people in the labor force. but prime age participation could be still higher.    income growth of low- and middle-income households has shown a pattern similar to that of participation, with two decades of disappointing news turning to better news during the past few years. according to census data, inflation-adjusted incomes for the lowest 20 percent of households declined slightly over the two decades through 2014, and income for the middle 20 percent rose only modestly. since then, incomes for these groups have risen more rapidly, as wage growth has picked up—and picked up most for the lower-paying jobs (figure 7).    recent years' data paint a hopeful picture of more people in their prime years in the workforce and wages rising for low- and middle-income workers. but as the people at our fed listens events emphasized, this is just a start: there is still plenty of room for building on these gains. the fed can play a role in this effort by steadfastly pursuing our goals of maximum employment and price stability. the research literature suggests a variety of policies, beyond the scope of monetary policy, that could spur further progress by better preparing people to meet the challenges of technological innovation and global competition and by supporting and rewarding labor force participation.6 these policies could bring immense benefits both to the lives of workers and families directly affected and to the strength of the economy overall. of course, the task of evaluating the costs and benefits of these policies falls to our elected representatives.    conclusion  monetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective. if the outlook changes materially, policy will change as well. at this point in the long expansion, i see the glass as much more than half full. with the right policies, we can fill it further, building on the gains so far and spreading the benefits more broadly to all americans."
2020-04-09,2789.82,"Chair_Powell_2020-April-9",1.44873780900225,"good morning. the challenge we face today is different in scope and character from those we have faced before. the coronavirus has spread quickly around the world, leaving a tragic and growing toll of illness and lost lives. this is first and foremost a public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those on the front lines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities. we watch in collective awe and gratitude as these dedicated individuals put themselves at risk in service to others and to our nation.    like other countries, we are taking forceful measures to control the spread of the virus. businesses have shuttered, workers are staying home, and we have suspended many basic social interactions. people have been asked to put their lives and livelihoods on hold, at significant economic and personal cost. we are moving with alarming speed from 50-year lows in unemployment to what will likely be very high, although temporary, levels.    all of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them. it is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an essential investment in our individual and collective health. as a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good.    the recently passed cares act is an important step in honoring that commitment, providing $2.2 trillion in relief to those who have lost their jobs, to low- and middle-income households, to employers of all sizes, to hospitals and health-care providers, and to state and local governments. and there are reports of additional legislation in the works. the critical task of delivering financial support directly to those most affected falls to elected officials, who use their powers of taxation and spending to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.    the fed can also contribute in important ways: by providing a measure of relief and stability during this period of constrained economic activity, and by using our tools to ensure that the eventual recovery is as vigorous as possible.    to those ends, we have lowered interest rates to near zero in order to bring down borrowing costs. we have also committed to keeping rates at this low level until we are confident that the economy has weathered the storm and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.    even more importantly, we have acted to safeguard financial markets in order to provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit in the economy. as a result of the economic dislocations caused by the virus, some essential financial markets had begun to sink into dysfunction, and many channels that households, businesses, and state and local governments rely on for credit had simply stopped working. we acted forcefully to get our markets working again, and, as a result, market conditions have generally improved.    many of the programs we are undertaking to support the flow of credit rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances—such as those we find ourselves in today—and only with the consent of the secretary of the treasury. we are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by the financial backing from congress and the treasury. we will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.    i would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers. the fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries. the fed can only make secured loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be fully repaid. in the situation we face today, many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. but there will also be entities of various kinds that need direct fiscal support rather than a loan they would struggle to repay.    our emergency measures are reserved for truly rare circumstances, such as those we face today. when the economy is well on its way back to recovery, and private markets and institutions are once again able to perform their vital functions of channeling credit and supporting economic growth, we will put these emergency tools away.    none of us has the luxury of choosing our challenges; fate and history provide them for us. our job is to meet the tests we are presented. at the fed, we are doing all we can to help shepherd the economy through this difficult time. when the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work. there is every reason to believe that the economic rebound, when it comes, can be robust. we entered this turbulent period on a strong economic footing, and that should help support the recovery. in the meantime, we are using our tools to help build a bridge from the solid economic foundation on which we entered this crisis to a position of regained economic strength on the other side.    i want to close by thanking the millions on the front lines: those working in health care, sanitation, transportation, grocery stores, warehouses, deliveries, security—including our own team at the federal reserve—and countless others. day after day, you have put yourselves in harm's way for others: to care for us, to ensure we have access to the things we need, and to help us through this difficult time."
2020-05-13,2820,"Chair_Powell_2020-May-13",-1.74626844870597,"the coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake as it has spread around the globe. this is a worldwide public health crisis, and health-care workers have been the first responders, showing courage and determination and earning our lasting gratitude. so have the legions of other essential workers who put themselves at risk every day on our behalf.    as a nation, we have temporarily withdrawn from many kinds of economic and social activity to help slow the spread of the virus. some sectors of the economy have been effectively closed since mid-march. people have put their lives and livelihoods on hold, making enormous sacrifices to protect not just their own health and that of their loved ones, but also their neighbors and the broader community. while we are all affected, the burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.    the scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since world war ii. we are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have been erased. since the pandemic arrived in force just two months ago, more than 20 million people have lost their jobs. a fed survey being released tomorrow reflects findings similar to many others: among people who were working in february, almost 40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year had lost a job in march.1 this reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.    this downturn is different from those that came before it. earlier in the post– world war ii period, recessions were sometimes linked to a cycle of high inflation followed by fed tightening.2 the lower inflation levels of recent decades have brought a series of long expansions, often accompanied by the buildup of imbalances over time—asset prices that reached unsupportable levels, for instance, or important sectors of the economy, such as housing, that boomed unsustainably. the current downturn is unique in that it is attributable to the virus and the steps taken to limit its fallout. this time, high inflation was not a problem. there was no economy-threatening bubble to pop and no unsustainable boom to bust. the virus is the cause, not the usual suspects—something worth keeping in mind as we respond.    today i will briefly discuss the measures taken so far to offset the economic effects of the virus, and the path ahead. governments around the world have responded quickly with measures to support workers who have lost income and businesses that have either closed or seen a sharp drop in activity. the response here in the united states has been particularly swift and forceful.    to date, congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion in fiscal support for households, businesses, health-care providers, and state and local governments—about 14 percent of gross domestic product. while the coronavirus economic shock appears to be the largest on record, the fiscal response has also been the fastest and largest response for any postwar downturn.    at the fed, we have also acted with unprecedented speed and force. after rapidly cutting the federal funds rate to close to zero, we took a wide array of additional measures to facilitate the flow of credit in the economy, which can be grouped into four areas. first, outright purchases of treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to restore functionality in these critical markets. second, liquidity and funding measures, including discount window measures, expanded swap lines with foreign central banks, and several facilities with treasury backing to support smooth functioning in money markets. third, with additional backing from the treasury, facilities to more directly support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. and fourth, temporary regulatory adjustments to encourage and allow banks to expand their balance sheets to support their household and business customers.    the fed takes actions such as these only in extraordinary circumstances, like those we face today. for example, our authority to extend credit directly to private nonfinancial businesses and state and local governments exists only in ""unusual and exigent circumstances"" and with the consent of the secretary of the treasury. when this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away.    while the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks. economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and today the virus raises a new set of questions: how quickly and sustainably will it be brought under control? can new outbreaks be avoided as social-distancing measures lapse? how long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume? and what will be the scope and timing of new therapies, testing, or a vaccine? the answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the economic recovery. since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be ready to address a range of possible outcomes.    the overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability, and will provide some support to the recovery when it comes. but the coronavirus crisis raises longer-term concerns as well. the record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.3 avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers' careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt.4 the loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life's work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes. these businesses are a principal source of job creation—something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work. a prolonged recession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion, further limiting the resurgence of jobs as well as the growth of capital stock and the pace of technological advancement. the result could be an extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes.    we ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require additional policy measures. at the fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way. recall that the fed has lending powers, not spending powers. a loan from a fed facility can provide a bridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many borrowers get through the current crisis. but the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems. additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. this tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending.    thank you. i look forward to our discussion."
2020-05-21,2948.51,"Chair_Powell_2020-May-21",-0.777356382567023,"good afternoon. i just want to say a few words of welcome and thank everyone for being here—albeit in much different circumstances than would otherwise be expected.    we've held many fed listens events over the past 16 months, and it's important to note that these conversations aren't just a nice way to talk to people from around the country, although they are that. what they provide—what you provide—is insight that we just can't get anywhere else. you add depth and definition to the flood of data that flows through the fed each day. you give us perspective on the economic realities that don't show up on a spreadsheet. you help us see those complex sets of data that analyze the american economy through the eyes of the people, businesses, and communities that make up the american economy. and that information is very helpful to us as we make our policy decisions.    so this is a valuable exercise for us. and an enjoyable one as well, so we truly do appreciate it on a number of levels. the reserve banks are also continuing to host conversations in communities across the country to help capture economic realities on the ground.    we are in the midst of an economic downturn without modern precedent. it was sudden, and it is severe. it has already erased the job gains of the past decade and has inflicted acute pain across the country. and while the burden is widespread, it is not evenly spread. those taking the brunt of the fallout are those least able to bear it.    the pain of this downturn is compounded by the upending of normal life, along with great uncertainty about the future. in the best of times, predicting the path of the economy with any certainty is difficult. john kenneth galbraith famously said that economic forecasting exists to make astrology look respectable. we are now experiencing a whole new level of uncertainty, as questions only the virus can answer complicate the outlook.    policies that address the resumption of economic activity are the province of elected officials at all levels of government, in close consultation with public health and medical professionals. but all of us have our own decisions to make as well, and those decisions will depend on public confidence that it is again safe to undertake various activities. from an economic perspective, we hope to learn a lot from your experiences and from what you're hearing from your colleagues, customers, and communities: how they're coping with that uncertainty now, how they're thinking about a future that's harder to plan for, and what matters most as they navigate the path.    the feedback we get from our community and business contacts has always been crucial in how we conduct monetary policy. in extraordinary times such as these, it takes on even greater importance. i want to thank you again for providing that insight and look forward to the conversation.    thank you."
2020-06-19,3097.74,"Chair_Powell_2020-Jun-19",-0.564946362194828,"thank you, president mester and treye johnson, and thanks to everyone for joining us. my job today is to listen, so i will keep my remarks short. but i do want to say that these conversations are incredibly valuable. they give context to reams of data and definition to a huge and complex economic picture. they also help solve problems on a practical level. feedback from our investing in america's workforce initiative found a pronounced need for workforce and economic development programs to more closely align, for instance. and employers' input has influenced work across the fed system, including the cleveland fed, as they look at how skills on the lower end of the pay scale can transfer to higher-earning jobs. so from me, and on behalf of my colleagues: thank you for your time today and for your ongoing insight.    it is not lost on me that we are meeting on juneteenth amid a renewed reckoning of racial injustice. the pandemic has again exposed a range of troubling inequalities, most of them of long standing. as the national discussion continues, it is critical to remember that equity includes access to education, work, and economic opportunity. i am reminded that dr. king delivered his ""i have a dream"" speech, just a few short blocks from the federal reserve, at a rally whose full title was the march on washington for jobs and freedom.    we meet today amid the immense hardship and suffering the coronavirus has caused. lives and livelihoods have been lost, and uncertainty looms large. we are all grateful to our frontline health-care workers who put themselves in harm's way every day and to the essential workers helping us meet our needs. while we are all affected, the burden has fallen disproportionately on those least able to bear it.    before the virus swept across the globe, the american economy was in a good place. we were experiencing the longest expansion on record, and unemployment had reached historic lows. however, that is a national average that can gloss over stark realities. that economic good fortune had eluded pockets across the country, including youngstown. a particular cruelty of the pandemic has been its disproportionate effects on many areas that were already suffering.    we will make our way back from this, but it will take time and work. some of the most valuable information we get from these discussions is how people are working to create growth. your feedback can be an invaluable example for other communities with similar challenges. the lordstown closure served as a reminder of how interconnected local economies can be, and other areas have experienced similar losses. your work on diversifying the economy, on skills development, on small business support programs, and in so many other areas can all serve as models for others to replicate.    the path ahead is likely to be challenging. but given the opportunity, i'll always bet on the american people and on the kind of community resolve and dedication we're hearing about today. i'm looking forward to your insight and to hearing more about how you've been working to revitalize youngstown's economy.    thank you."

as a vital platform for discussing the most challenging economic issues of the day. judging by the agenda and the papers, this year will be no exception.    for the past year and a half, my colleagues and i on the federal open market committee (fomc) have been conducting the first-ever public review of our monetary policy framework.1 earlier today we released a revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, a document that lays out our goals, articulates our framework for monetary policy, and serves as the foundation for our policy actions.2 today i will discuss our review, the changes in the economy that motivated us to undertake it, and our revised statement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the review.    evolution of the fed's monetary policy framework  we began this public review in early 2019 to assess the monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications that would best foster achievement of our congressionally assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability over the years ahead in service to the american people. because the economy is always evolving, the fomc's strategy for achieving its goals—our policy framework—must adapt to meet the new challenges that arise. forty years ago, the biggest problem our economy faced was high and rising inflation.3 the great inflation demanded a clear focus on restoring the credibility of the fomc's commitment to price stability. chair paul volcker brought that focus to bear, and the ""volcker disinflation,"" with the continuing stewardship of alan greenspan, led to the stabilization of inflation and inflation expectations in the 1990s at around 2 percent. the monetary policies of the volcker era laid the foundation for the long period of economic stability known as the great moderation. this new era brought new challenges to the conduct of monetary policy. before the great moderation, expansions typically ended in overheating and rising inflation. since then, prior to the current pandemic-induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been more likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.4    by the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting.5 although the precise features of inflation targeting differed from country to country, the core framework always articulated an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy. inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions. this emphasis on transparency reflected what was then a new appreciation that policy is most effective when it is clearly understood by the public. inflation-targeting central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation: those with ""flexible"" inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in addition to their inflation objective.    under ben bernanke's leadership, the federal reserve adopted many of the features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6 we made great advances in transparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and the summary of economic projections (sep), which comprises the individual economic forecasts of fomc participants. during that time, then–board vice chair janet yellen led an effort on behalf of the fomc to codify the committee's approach to monetary policy. in january 2012, the committee issued its first statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which we often refer to as the consensus statement. a central part of this statement was the articulation of a longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.7 because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the committee did not set a numerical objective for maximum employment. however, the statement affirmed the committee's commitment to fulfilling both of its congressionally mandated goals. the 2012 statement was a significant milestone, reflecting lessons learned from fighting high inflation as well as from experience around the world with flexible inflation targeting. the statement largely articulated the policy framework the committee had been following for some time.8    motivation for the review  the completion of the original consensus statement in january 2012 occurred early on in the recovery from the global financial crisis, when notions of what the ""new normal"" might bring were quite uncertain. since then, our understanding of the economy has evolved in ways that are central to monetary policy. of course, the conduct of monetary policy has also evolved. a key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9    our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review. first, assessments of the potential, or longer-run, growth rate of the economy have declined. for example, since january 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from fomc participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (see figure 1). some slowing in growth relative to earlier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing population growth and the aging of the population. more troubling has been the decline in productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards over time.10    second, the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the united states and around the world. estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or ""r-star."" this rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growth—the same factors that drive potential economic growth.11 the median estimate from fomc participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2).    this decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound implications for monetary policy. with interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12 the result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.    third, and on a happier note, the record-long expansion that ended earlier this year led to the best labor market we had seen in some time. the unemployment rate hovered near 50-year lows for roughly 2 years, well below most estimates of its sustainable level. and the unemployment rate captures only part of the story. having declined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation rate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that it should keep falling.13 for individuals in their prime working years, the participation rate fully retraced its post-crisis decline, defying earlier assessments that the global financial crisis might cause permanent structural damage to the labor market.    moreover, as the long expansion continued, the gains began to be shared more widely across society. the black and hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.14 as we heard repeatedly in our fed listens events, the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15 in addition, many who had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy. before the pandemic, there was every reason to expect that these gains would continue. it is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.    fourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in inflation. over the years, forecasts from fomc participants and private-sector analysts routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized on a sustained basis (see figure 3). inflation forecasts are typically predicated on estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, or ""u-star,"" and of how much upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate falls relative to u-star.16 as the unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were revised down. for example, the median estimate from fomc participants declined from 5.5 percent in 2012 to 4.1 percent at present (see figure 4). the muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17 in addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated. other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.    the persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer-run objective is a cause for concern. many find it counterintuitive that the fed would want to push up inflation. after all, low and stable inflation is essential for a well-functioning economy. and we are certainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes. however, inflation that is persistently too low can pose serious risks to the economy. inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.    this dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the general level of interest rates. well-anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving the fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18 but if inflation expectations fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates would decline in tandem. in turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn, further diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates. we have seen this adverse dynamic play out in other major economies around the world and have learned that once it sets in, it can be very difficult to overcome. we want to do what we can to prevent such a dynamic from happening here.    elements of the review  we began our review with these changes in the economy in mind. the review had three pillars: a series of fed listens events held around the country, a flagship research conference, and a series of committee discussions supported by rigorous staff analysis. as is appropriate in our democratic society, we have sought extensive engagement with the public throughout the review.    the fed listens events built on a long-standing practice around the federal reserve system of engaging with community groups. the 15 events involved a wide range of participants—workforce development groups, union members, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others—to hear about how our policies affect peoples' daily lives and livelihoods.19 the stories we heard at fed listens events became a potent vehicle for us to connect with the people and communities that our policies are intended to benefit. one of the clear messages we heard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before the pandemic was generating employment opportunities for many americans who in the past had not found jobs readily available. a clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving and sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-income communities.    the research conference brought together some of the world's leading academic experts to address topics central to our review, and the presentations and robust discussion we engaged in were an important input to our review process.20    finally, the committee explored the range of issues that were brought to light during the course of the review in five consecutive meetings beginning in july 2019. analytical staff work put together by teams across the federal reserve system provided essential background for each of the committee's discussions.21    our plans to conclude the review earlier this year were, like so many things, delayed by the arrival of the pandemic. when we resumed our discussions last month, we turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.    new statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy  the federated structure of the federal reserve, reflected in the fomc, ensures that we always have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today. nonetheless, i am pleased to say that the revised consensus statement was adopted today with the unanimous support of committee participants. our new consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. before addressing the key changes in our statement, let me highlight some areas of continuity. we continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy. the significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point. in addition, we have not changed our view that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability. finally, we continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy's effect on the economy. thus, our policy actions continue to depend on the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, including potential risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of our goals.    the key innovations in our new consensus statement reflect the changes in the economy i described. our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. by reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 to counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.    with regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal. this change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23 in addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24 this change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.    in earlier decades when the phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market. it was sometimes appropriate for the fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation. the change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25 of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.    we have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of our mandate. our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent. our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. however, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent. households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down. to prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.    in seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average. thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26 our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula. of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.    the revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework. to an extent, these revisions reflect the way we have been conducting policy in recent years. at the same time, however, there are some important new features. overall, our new statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. in conducting monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for the benefit of all americans. and we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 2 percent inflation rate over time.    looking ahead  our review has provided a platform for productive discussion and engagement with the public we serve. the fed listens events helped us connect with our core constituency, the american people, and hear directly how their everyday lives are affected by our policies. we believe that conducting a review at regular intervals is a good institutional practice, providing valuable feedback and enhancing transparency and accountability. and with the ever-changing economy, future reviews will allow us to take a step back, reflect on what we have learned, and adapt our practices as we strive to achieve our dual-mandate goals. as our statement indicates, we plan to undertake a thorough public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices roughly every five years."
2020-10-06,3360.95,"Chair_Powell_2020-Oct-6",-1.39880245142477,"good morning. it has been just eight months since the pandemic first gained a foothold on our shores, bringing with it the sharpest downturn on record, as well as the most forceful policy response in living memory. although it is too early for definitive conclusions, today i will offer a current assessment of the response to the economic fallout of this historic event and discuss the path ahead.    the pre-covid economy  as the coronavirus spread across the globe, the u.s. economy was in its 128th month of expansion—the longest in our recorded history—and was generally in a strong position. moderate growth continued at a slightly above-trend pace. labor market conditions were strong across a range of measures. the unemployment rate was running at 50-year lows. pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was running just below our 2 percent target.    the economy did face longer-term challenges, as all economies do. labor force participation among people in their prime working years had been trending down since the turn of the millennium, and productivity gains during the expansion were disappointing. income and wealth disparities had been growing for several decades. as the expansion continued its long run, however, productivity started to pick up, the labor market strengthened, and the benefits of growth began to be more widely shared. in particular, improved labor market conditions during the past few years encouraged more prime-age workers to rejoin or remain in the labor force. meanwhile, real wage gains for all workers picked up, especially for those in lower paying jobs.    most economic forecasters expected the expansion and its benefits to continue, and with good reason. there was no economy-threatening asset bubble to pop and no unsustainable boom to bust. while nonfinancial business leverage appeared to be elevated, leverage in the household sector was moderate. the banking system was strong, with robust levels of capital and liquidity. the covid-19 recession was unusual in that it was not triggered by a buildup of financial or economic imbalances. instead, the pandemic shock was essentially a case of a natural disaster hitting a healthy economy.    given the condition of the economy, in the early stages of the crisis it seemed plausible that, with a rapid, forceful, and sustained policy response, many sectors of the economy would be able to bounce back strongly once the virus was under control. that response would need to come from actions across all levels of government, from health and fiscal authorities, and from the federal reserve.    it also seemed likely that the sectors most affected by the pandemic—those relying on extensive in-person contact—would face a long and difficult path to recovery. these sectors and people working in them would likely need targeted and sustained policy support.    some asked what the fed could do to address what was essentially a medical emergency. we identified three ways that our tools could help limit the economic damage from the pandemic: providing stability and relief during the acute phase of the crisis when much of the economy was shut down; vigorously supporting the expansion when it came; and doing what we could to limit longer-run damage to the productive capacity of the economy.    the recession and nascent recovery  when it became clear in late february that the disease was spreading worldwide, financial markets were roiled by a global flight to cash. by the end of the month, many important markets were faltering, raising the threat of a financial crisis that could exacerbate the economic fallout of the pandemic. widespread economic shutdowns began in march, and in the united states, with many sectors shut down or operating well below capacity, real gdp fell 31 percent in the second quarter on an annualized basis. employers slashed payrolls by 22 million, with those on temporary layoff rising by 17 million. broader measures of labor market conditions, such as labor force participation and those working part time for economic reasons, showed further damage.    in response, we deployed the full range of tools at our disposal, cutting rates to their effective lower bound; conducting unprecedented quantities of asset purchases; and establishing a range of emergency lending facilities to restore market function and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. we also implemented targeted and temporary measures to allow banks to better support their customers.    the fiscal response was truly extraordinary. the unanimous passage of the cares act and three other bills passed with broad support in march and april established wide-ranging programs that are expected to provide roughly $3 trillion in economic support overall—by far the largest and most innovative fiscal response to an economic crisis since the great depression.    what have these policies managed to accomplish so far?    first, the substantial fiscal aid has given vital support to households. the rise in transfers supported necessary spending and contributed to a sharp increase in household saving. goods consumption is now above its pre-pandemic level. services consumption remains low, although it seems likely that much of this weakness is the byproduct of health concerns and social distancing, rather than reductions in income and wealth. consumption held up well through august after the expiration of expanded unemployment insurance benefits, indicating that savings from transfer payments continue to support economic activity. a recent fed survey showed that households in july had surprisingly upbeat views of their current financial well-being, with 77 percent of adults either ""doing okay"" or ""living comfortably,"" an improvement even over the reading immediately preceding the pandemic.1 still, since it appears that many will undergo extended periods of unemployment, there is likely to be a need for further support.    second, aid to firms—in particular, the paycheck protection program—and the general boost to aggregate demand have so far partly forestalled an expected wave of bankruptcies and lessened permanent layoffs. business investment appears to be on a renewed upward trajectory and new business formation similarly appears to be rebounding, pointing to some confidence in the path ahead.    third, after briefly seizing up in march, financial markets have largely returned to normal functioning, albeit in the context of extensive ongoing policy support. financial conditions are highly accommodative, and credit is available on reasonable terms for many—though not all—households and businesses. interest-sensitive spending has been relatively strong, as shown in the housing and auto sectors.    taken together, fiscal and monetary policy actions have so far supported a strong but incomplete recovery in demand and have—for now—substantially muted the normal recessionary dynamics that occur in a downturn. in a typical recession, there is a downward spiral in which layoffs lead to still lower demand, and subsequent additional layoffs. this dynamic was disrupted by the infusion of funds to households and businesses. prompt and forceful policy actions were also likely responsible for reducing risk aversion in financial markets and business decisions more broadly.    while the combined effects of fiscal and monetary policy have aided the solid recovery of the labor market so far, there is still a long way to go. payrolls have now recovered roughly half of the 22 million decline. after rising to 14.7 percent in april, the unemployment rate is back to 7.9 percent, clearly a significant and rapid rebound. a broader measure that better captures current labor market conditions—by adjusting for mistaken characterizations of job status, and for the decline in labor force participation since february—is running around 11 percent.    the burdens of the downturn have not been evenly shared. the initial job losses fell most heavily on lower-wage workers in service industries facing the public—job categories in which minorities and women are overrepresented. in august, employment of those in the bottom quartile of the wage distribution was still 21 percent below its february level, while it was only 4 percent lower for other workers.2 combined with the disproportionate effects of covid on communities of color, and the overwhelming burden of childcare during quarantine and distance learning, which has fallen mostly on women, the pandemic is further widening divides in wealth and economic mobility.    the road ahead  i will now turn to the outlook. the recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected. the most recent projections by fomc (federal open market committee) participants at our september meeting show the recovery continuing at a solid pace. the median participant saw unemployment declining to 4 percent and inflation reaching 2 percent by the end of 2023. of course, the economy may perform better or worse than expected. the outlook remains highly uncertain, in part because it depends on controlling the spread and effects of the virus. there is a risk that the rapid initial gains from reopening may transition to a longer than expected slog back to full recovery as some segments struggle with the pandemic's continued fallout. the pace of economic improvement has moderated since the outsize gains of may and june, as is evident in employment, income, and spending data. the increase in permanent job loss, as well as recent layoffs, are also notable.    we should continue do what we can to manage downside risks to the outlook. one such risk is that covid-19 cases might again rise to levels that more significantly limit economic activity, not to mention the tragic effects on lives and well-being. managing this risk as the expansion continues will require following medical experts' guidance, including using masks and social-distancing measures.    a second risk is that a prolonged slowing in the pace of improvement over time could trigger typical recessionary dynamics, as weakness feeds on weakness. a long period of unnecessarily slow progress could continue to exacerbate existing disparities in our economy. that would be tragic, especially in light of our country's progress on these issues in the years leading up to the pandemic.    the expansion is still far from complete. at this early stage, i would argue that the risks of policy intervention are still asymmetric. too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses. over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth. by contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller. even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste. the recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.    given this audience, i would be remiss were i not to mention our review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications, which concluded recently with our adoption of a flexible average inflation-targeting regime. my colleagues and i have discussed this new framework in detail in recent remarks. today i will just note that the underlying structure of the economy changes over time, and that the fomc's framework for conducting monetary policy must keep pace. the recent changes to our consensus statement reflect our evolving understanding of several important developments. there has been a decline in estimates of the potential or longer-run growth rate of the economy and in the general level of interest rates, presenting challenges for the ability of monetary policy to respond to a downturn. on a more positive note, we have seen that the economy can sustain historically high levels of employment, bringing significant societal benefits and without causing a troubling rise in inflation. the new consensus statement acknowledges these developments and makes appropriate changes in our monetary policy framework to position the fomc to best achieve its statutory goals.    the forward rate guidance adopted at our september meeting reflects our new consensus statement. the new guidance says that, with inflation running persistently below our longer-run 2 percent goal, the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of policy until these outcomes are achieved. the committee also left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 0 to 1/4 percent, and it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels that are consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.    we expect that the new framework and guidance will support our efforts in pursuit of a strong economic recovery.    thank you. i look forward to our discussion."
2021-02-10,3909.88,"Chair_Powell_2021-Feb-10",-0.0345159962467027,"today i will discuss the state of our labor market, from the recent past to the present and then over the longer term. a strong labor market that is sustained for an extended period can deliver substantial economic and social benefits, including higher employment and income levels, improved and expanded job opportunities, narrower economic disparities, and healing of the entrenched damage inflicted by past recessions on individuals' economic and personal well-being. at present, we are a long way from such a labor market. fully realizing the benefits of a strong labor market will take continued support from both near-term policy and longer-run investments so that all those seeking jobs have the skills and opportunities that will enable them to contribute to, and share in, the benefits of prosperity.    the labor market of a year ago  we need only look to february of last year to see how beneficial a strong labor market can be. the overall unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, the lowest level in a half-century. the unemployment rate for african americans had also reached historical lows (figure 1). prime-age labor force participation was the highest in over a decade, and a high proportion of households saw jobs as ""plentiful.""1 overall wage growth was moderate, but wages were rising more rapidly for earners on the lower end of the scale. these encouraging statistics were reaffirmed and given voice by those we met and conferred with, including the community, labor, and business leaders; retirees; students; and others we met with during the 14 fed listens events we conducted in 2019.2    many of these gains had emerged only in the later years of the expansion. the labor force participation rate, for example, had been steadily declining from 2008 to 2015 even as the recovery from the global financial crisis unfolded. in fact, in 2015, prime-age labor force participation—which i focus on because it is not significantly affected by the aging of the population—reached its lowest level in 30 years even as the unemployment rate declined to a relatively low 5 percent. also concerning was that much of the decline in participation up to that point had been concentrated in the population without a college degree (figure 2). at the time, many forecasters worried that globalization and technological change might have permanently reduced job opportunities for these individuals, and that, as a result, there might be limited scope for participation to recover.    fortunately, the participation rate after 2015 consistently outperformed expectations, and by the beginning of 2020, the prime-age participation rate had fully reversed its decline from the 2008-to-2015 period. moreover, gains in participation were concentrated among people without a college degree. given that u.s. labor force participation has lagged relative to other advanced economy nations, this progress was especially welcome (figure 3).3    as i mentioned, we also saw faster wage growth for low earners once the labor market had strengthened sufficiently. nearly six years into the recovery, wage growth for the lowest earning quartile had been persistently modest and well below the pace enjoyed by other workers. at the tipping point of 2015, however, as the labor market continued to strengthen, the trend reversed, with wage growth for the lowest quartile consistently and significantly exceeding that of other workers (figure 4).    at the end of 2015, the black unemployment rate was still quite elevated, at 9 percent, despite the relatively low overall unemployment rate. but that disparity too began to shrink; as the expansion continued beyond 2015, black unemployment reached a historic low of 5.2 percent, and the gap between black and white unemployment rates was the narrowest since 1972, when data on unemployment by race started to be collected. black unemployment has tended to rise more than overall unemployment in recessions but also to fall more quickly in expansions.4 over the course of a long expansion, these persistent disparities can decline significantly, but, without policies to address their underlying causes, they may increase again when the economy ultimately turns down.    these late-breaking improvements in the labor market did not result in unwanted upward pressures on inflation, as might have been expected; in fact, inflation did not even rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis. there was every reason to expect that the labor market could have strengthened even further without causing a worrisome increase in inflation were it not for the onset of the pandemic.    the labor market today  the state of our labor market today could hardly be more different. despite the surprising speed of recovery early on, we are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared. employment in january of this year was nearly 10 million below its february 2020 level, a greater shortfall than the worst of the great recession's aftermath (figure 5).    after rising to 14.8 percent in april of last year, the published unemployment rate has fallen relatively swiftly, reaching 6.3 percent in january. but published unemployment rates during covid have dramatically understated the deterioration in the labor market. most importantly, the pandemic has led to the largest 12-month decline in labor force participation since at least 1948.5 fear of the virus and the disappearance of employment opportunities in the sectors most affected by it, such as restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, have led many to withdraw from the workforce. at the same time, virtual schooling has forced many parents to leave the work force to provide all-day care for their children. all told, nearly 5 million people say the pandemic prevented them from looking for work in january. in addition, the bureau of labor statistics reports that many unemployed individuals have been misclassified as employed. correcting this misclassification and counting those who have left the labor force since last february as unemployed would boost the unemployment rate to close to 10 percent in january (figure 6).    unfortunately, even those grim statistics understate the decline in labor market conditions for the most economically vulnerable americans. aggregate employment has declined 6.5 percent since last february, but the decline in employment for workers in the top quartile of the wage distribution has been only 4 percent, while the decline for the bottom quartile has been a staggering 17 percent (figure 7). moreover, employment for these workers has changed little in recent months, while employment for the higher-wage groups has continued to improve. similarly, the unemployment rates for blacks and hispanics have risen significantly more than for whites since february 2020 (figure 8). as a result, economic disparities that were already too wide have widened further.    in the past few months, improvement in labor market conditions stalled as the rate of infections sharply increased. in particular, jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector dropped over 1/2 million in december and a further 61,000 in january. the recovery continues to depend on controlling the spread of the virus, which will require mass vaccinations in addition to continued vigilance in social distancing and mask wearing in the meantime.    since the onset of the pandemic, we have been concerned about its longer-term effects on the labor market. extended periods of unemployment can inflict persistent damage on lives and livelihoods while also eroding the productive capacity of the economy.6 and we know from the previous expansion that it can take many years to reverse the damage.    at the start of the pandemic, the increase in unemployment was almost entirely due to temporary job losses.7 temporarily laid-off workers tend to return to work much more quickly, on average, than those whose ties to their former employers are permanently severed. but as some sectors of the economy have continued to struggle, permanent job loss has increased (figure 9). so too has long-term unemployment. still, as of january, the level of permanent job loss, as a fraction of the labor force, was considerably smaller than during the great recession. research shows that the paycheck protection program has played an important role in limiting permanent layoffs and preserving small businesses.8 the renewal of the program this year in the face of another surge in covid-related job cuts is an encouraging development.    of course, in a healthy market-based economy, perpetual churn will always render some jobs obsolete as they are replaced by new employment opportunities. over time, workers and capital move from firm to firm and from sector to sector. it is likely that the pandemic has both increased the need for such movements and brought forward some movement that would have occurred eventually.9    getting back to a strong labor market  so how do we get from where we are today back to a strong labor market that benefits all americans and that starts to heal the damage already done? and what can we do to sustain those benefits over time? experience tells us that getting to and staying at full employment will not be easy. in the near term, policies that bring the pandemic to an end as soon as possible are paramount. in addition, workers and households who struggle to find their place in the post-pandemic economy are likely to need continued support. the same is true for many small businesses that are likely to prosper again once the pandemic is behind us.    also important is a patiently accommodative monetary policy stance that embraces the lessons of the past—about the labor market in particular and the economy more generally. i described several of those important lessons, as well as our new policy framework, at the jackson hole conference last year.10 i have already mentioned the broad-based benefits that a strong labor market can deliver and noted that many of these benefits only arose toward the end of the previous expansion. i also noted that these benefits were achieved with low inflation. indeed, inflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times.    in addition, we have seen that the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy appears to be lower than it once was, in part because of population aging, and that the neutral rate of interest—or the rate consistent with the economy being at full employment with 2 percent inflation—is also much lower than before. a low neutral rate means that our policy rate will be constrained more often by the effective lower bound. that circumstance can lead to worse economic outcomes—particularly for the most economically vulnerable americans.    to take these economic developments into account, we made substantial revisions to our monetary policy framework, as described in the fomc's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.11 this revised statement shares many features with its predecessor, including our view that longer-run inflation of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. but it also has some innovations.    the revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. this change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities. recognizing the economy's ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted increase in inflation, the statement says that our policy decisions will be informed by our ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level.""12 this means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. finally, to counter the adverse economic dynamics that could ensue from declines in inflation expectations in an environment where our main policy tool is more frequently constrained, we now explicitly seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. this means that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.    our january postmeeting statement on monetary policy implements this new framework.13 in particular, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. in addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities by $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.    the broad responsibility for achieving maximum employment  seventy-five years ago, in the wake of wwii, the united states faced the challenge of reemploying millions amid a major restructuring of the economy toward peacetime ends.14 part of congress's response was the employment act of 1946, which states that ""it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government to use all practicable means . . . to promote maximum employment.""15 as later amended in the humphrey-hawkins act, this provision formed the basis of the employment side of the fed's dual mandate. my colleagues and i are strongly committed to doing all we can to promote this employment goal.    given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post-pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy. it will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector. the potential benefits of investing in our nation's workforce are immense. steady employment provides more than a regular paycheck. it also bestows a sense of purpose, improves mental health, increases lifespans, and benefits workers and their families.16 i am confident that with our collective efforts across the government and the private sector, our nation will make sustained progress toward our national goal of maximum employment."
2021-03-18,3915.46,"Chair_Powell_2021-Mar-18",-1.47605004378327,"i would like to thank sir jon cunliffe and the committee on payments and market infrastructures (cpmi) for inviting me to close out the first day of this conference on pushing the frontiers of payments.    last year, the group of twenty (g-20) asked the financial stability board (fsb) to coordinate the development of a roadmap on how the global community could enhance cross-border payments. it has long been acknowledged that the existing system, while safe and dependable, suffers from frictions, including processes that make it difficult to comply with anti-money-laundering and countering-terrorist-financing requirements, difficulty in managing payments across time zones, and, in certain areas, a reliance on outdated technology. moreover, these frictions contribute to higher costs for cross-border transactions.    as with many aspects of life these days, the covid-19 pandemic has shined a light on the less efficient areas of our current payment system and accelerated the desire for improvement and digitalization. even before the pandemic, advancements in the private sector served as a catalyst to get the attention of consumers and to prompt more engagement by the public sector.    the goal of the fsb roadmap is simple—to create an ecosystem for cross-border payments that is faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive. a year into the process, i am encouraged that we are making meaningful progress. the stage 3 report released in october laid out a practical set of steps for moving ahead on the 19 building blocks that will bring about an improved system.1    indeed, the themes discussed in the four sessions of the conference today correspond well to approaches described in the building blocks. the title of the first panel sets up a choice between ""improving existing rails or laying new tracks."" as the roadmap makes clear, one of the keys to moving forward will be doing both—improving the existing system where we can while also evaluating the potential of and the best uses for emerging technologies. as an example, the federal reserve is working to improve the current system through the introduction of instant or fast payments via the fednow service.2 the service will be designed to maintain uninterrupted processing—24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year—with security features that will ensure payment integrity and data security. the target launch date is sometime in 2023.*    the federal reserve is also doing its part to examine the role of new technologies. experiments with central bank digital currencies (cbdcs) are being conducted at the board of governors, as well as complementary efforts by the federal reserve bank of boston in collaboration with researchers at mit. in addition, a recent report from the bank for international settlements and a group of seven central banks, which includes the fed, assessed the feasibility of cbdcs in helping central banks deliver their public policy objectives.3 relevant to today's topic, one of the three key principles highlighted in the report is that a cbdc needs to coexist with cash and other types of money in a flexible and innovative payment system.    improvements in the global payments system will come not just from the public sector, but from the private sector as well. as today's second panel, ""of lions and unicorns,"" described, the private sector has the experience and expertise to develop consumer-facing infrastructure that improves and simplifies how the public engages with the financial system. digitalization of financial services, combined with an improved consumer experience, can help increase financial inclusion, particularly in countries or areas with a large unbanked population.    and the last two panels of the day, ""addressing legal barriers to cross-border payments"" and ""harmonised data to oil the cross-border payments machinery,"" highlight that improving the system must be a collaborative effort. by definition, cross-border payments involve multiple jurisdictions. so it will only be through countries working together, via all of the international forums—the group of seven, the g-20, the cpmi, the fsb, and others—that solutions will be possible.    and, finally, it is only by engaging all stakeholders—policymakers, private-sector participants, and academia—as this conference is doing, that we will achieve the improved payments ecosystem we are striving toward.    the covid crisis has brought into even sharper focus the need to address the limitations of our current arrangements for cross-border payments. and as this conference amply demonstrates, despite the challenges of this last year, we still have been able to make important progress. i again thank the cpmi and jon cunliffe for their leadership and look forward to working together as we improve these payments for businesses and individuals alike."
2021-05-03,4192.66,"Chair_Powell_2021-May-03",0.274803464102148,"good afternoon. it is a pleasure to be with you today.    together, over the past year, we have been making our way through a very difficult time. we are not out of the woods yet, but i am glad to say that we are now making real progress. while some countries are still suffering terribly in the grip of covid-19, the economic outlook here in the united states has clearly brightened. vaccination levels are rising. fiscal and monetary policy are providing strong support. the economy is reopening, bringing stronger economic activity and job creation.    that is the high-level perspective—let's call it the 30,000 foot view—and from that vantage point, we see improvement. but we should also take a look at what is happening at street level. lives and livelihoods have been affected in ways that vary from person to person, family to family, and community to community. the economic downturn has not fallen evenly on all americans, and those least able to bear the burden have been the hardest hit.    the pain is all the greater in light of the gains we had seen in the years prior to the pandemic. covid swept in as the united states was experiencing the longest expansion on record. unemployment was at 50-year lows, and inflation remained under control. wages were moving up, particularly for the lowest-paid workers. long-standing racial disparities in unemployment were narrowing, and many who had struggled for years were finding jobs. it was not until the later years of that expansion that its benefits had started to reach those on the margins. during our fed listens events, we met with people around the country and heard repeatedly about the life-changing gains of the strong labor market, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum. just a few months later, those stories changed to ones of job losses, overextended support services, and businesses built over generations closing their doors for good.    while the recovery is gathering strength, it has been slower for those in lower-paid jobs: almost 20 percent of workers who were in the lowest earnings quartile in february of 2020 were not employed a year later, compared to 6 percent for workers in the highest quartile.1    the fed's latest survey of household economics and decisionmaking—or shed report—which will be published later this month, will show that, for prime-age adults without a bachelor's degree, 20 percent saw layoffs in 2020 versus 12 percent for college-educated workers. and more than 20 percent of black and hispanic prime-age workers were laid off compared to 14 percent of white workers over the same period.    small businesses have also faced immense difficulties. fed research found that 80 percent of those surveyed reported a decline in revenue, with two-thirds of those businesses experiencing losses of at least 25 percent.2 a recent federal reserve special report looked specifically at the impact on businesses owned by people of color, who reported greater challenges. for example, 67 percent of both asian- and black-owned firms and 63 percent of hispanic-owned firms had to reduce their operations compared to 54 percent for their white counterparts.3    our upcoming shed report notes that 22 percent of parents were either not working or working less because of disruptions to childcare or in-person schooling. black and hispanic mothers—36 percent and 30 percent, respectively—were disproportionately affected. in a similar vein, labor force participation declined around 4 percentage points for black and hispanic women compared to 1.6 percentage points for white women and about 2 percentage points for men overall.4 the fed is focused on these long-standing disparities because they weigh on the productive capacity of our economy. we will only reach our full potential when everyone can contribute to, and share in, the benefits of prosperity.    achieving broadly shared prosperity will take action from across society, from fiscal and other government policy to private-sector initiatives to the work everyone here does. the fed can contribute as well. using our monetary policy tools, the fed promotes maximum employment and price stability—two foundations of a strong, stable economy that can improve economic outcomes for all americans. we view maximum employment as a broad and inclusive goal. those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities. our recent history highlights both the benefits of a strong economy and the severe costs of a weak one.    supervisory tools also have a role to play. as part of our policy responsibilities, the board of governors enforces both the fair housing act and the equal credit opportunity act, the federal fair lending laws that prohibit discrimination in lending. violations of the fair lending laws, along with other illegal credit practices, are taken into account during bank evaluations under the community reinvestment act (cra). we see our robust supervisory approach as critical to addressing racial discrimination, which can limit consumers' ability to improve their economic circumstances, including through access to homeownership and education.    the fed's community development function plays a role as well, studying what works, convening stakeholders on both the national and district level, and helping financial institutions find opportunities to invest and expand credit opportunities in low- and moderate-income communities.    the economic landscape has changed, and efforts to provide access and credit to communities must change with it. last year, the fed issued a proposal for a strengthened, modernized cra framework, with the objective of building broad support among both external stakeholders and participating agencies. our goal is to strengthen the core purpose of meeting the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities. we especially appreciated ncrc's feedback on the proposal.    we will continue to do our part, and we appreciate the ways our work and that of ncrc members have intersected. last april, for instance, the fed expanded the paycheck protection program liquidity facility in order to broaden its reach to include some nondepository lenders. that included cdfi (community development financial institution) loan funds, which many of the people here represent. your work provided small businesses with invaluable technical assistance to help them weather the downturn, and you have helped them get the funds they need to support their businesses.    ncrc member groups have contributed in so many ways. you helped workers who lost their jobs get retrained. you supported working parents. you helped homeowners struggling with payments and connected renters to federal assistance programs. you brought more people into the banking system, helped strengthen financial literacy and capabilities, and worked to address digital divides in areas of need—particularly in rural communities—at a time when connectivity is essential.    i would like to close by saying thank you. you have been working hard through this crisis, and an enormous amount of work still lies ahead. but what you do is essential. you provide an invaluable service: you make people's lives better. there is no higher calling.    thank you."
2021-08-17,4448.08,"Chair_Powell_2021-Aug-17",-0.706072491299662,"thank you, gigi and scott, and thanks to everyone for your work in bringing us together today, particularly the economic education group. congratulations on the launch of economic education month as well. we're very proud of this initiative and looking forward to what you have in store for us in october.    it's a pleasure to be here, albeit in a very different format than we're used to. the downside is that we don't get to connect in quite the same way as we do in person. the upside is that we're able to include a lot more people. and wear much more comfortable clothes.    before i turn to your questions, i want to say a few words to recognize the incredibly powerful work you all do as teachers. it would be important to mention this in any year, but especially now, in the 17th month of our upended reality. at the fed, we take the value and responsibility of public service pretty seriously, and there really is no greater contribution to the common good than teaching.    the pandemic has been tough on everyone, but it has asked more of some than others. making it through this time has been no small feat for anyone, but teachers deserve distinct praise and appreciation. educators have had to restructure their teaching, adapt to new platforms, and help their students make their way through added stresses and pitfalls. that must have been especially tough without the day-to-day interactions that help you connect. it is clear that so many teachers have gone above and beyond the call of duty to remain a consistent, reliable resource for their students.    parents deserve a shout-out as well for their part in helping reconstruct something as enormous and consequential as our entire education system.    and students have also shown remarkable courage and resilience. for all of us, daily life has been disrupted, milestones like birthdays and graduations have been missed, and a once-in-a-lifetime crisis has cast a shadow of insecurity and uncertainty. but to take on that burden as a formative experience is extraordinary. you should all feel proud.    finding the bright side to the past 17 months is not easy, but the crisis has given us a unique opportunity to see the big picture and consider our place in it. this is a historical inflection point, and this generation of students is in a position to turn its lessons into profound tools of change.    and i hope some of you will use those tools in public service.    the students here today are the policymakers and legislators of the future. your teachers are the ones with the daunting task of preparing you for that future.    you will see the world differently than your predecessors. you have been forced, sooner than most people, to consider what in life is truly important. you have seen a world upended, but you have also seen a world that is rapidly changing—sometimes more in one week than some of us have experienced over the course of decades. i hope this will cause you to think about how you want to make your mark, knowing that things do change, and sometimes they change quickly.    this is an extraordinary time, and i believe that it will result in an extraordinary generation. as long as we continue to have extraordinary educators to guide them there.    education is the foundation of our economy, indeed, of our society. teachers have always been tasked with nurturing and overseeing our most valuable national resource. it is the highest call within the higher calling of public service. i want to thank all of the teachers—those here today and the rest across the country—as well as the parents and students who have come together to make it through the past year and a half.    thank you, and i look forward to your questions."
2021-08-27,4509.37,"Chair_Powell_2021-Aug-27",0.880760626398208,"seventeen months have passed since the u.s. economy faced the full force of the covid-19 pandemic. this shock led to an immediate and unprecedented decline as large parts of the economy were shuttered to contain the spread of the disease.    the path of recovery has been a difficult one, and a good place to begin is by thanking those on the front line fighting the pandemic: the essential workers who kept the economy going, those who have cared for others in need, and those in medical research, business, and government, who came together to discover, produce, and widely distribute effective vaccines in record time. we should also keep in our thoughts those who have lost their lives from covid, as well as their loved ones.    strong policy support has fueled a vigorous but uneven recovery—one that is, in many respects, historically anomalous. in a reversal of typical patterns in a downturn, aggregate personal income rose rather than fell, and households massively shifted their spending from services to manufactured goods. booming demand for goods and the strength and speed of the reopening have led to shortages and bottlenecks, leaving the covid-constrained supply side unable to keep up. the result has been elevated inflation in durable goods—a sector that has experienced an annual inflation rate well below zero over the past quarter century.1 labor market conditions are improving but turbulent, and the pandemic continues to threaten not only health and life, but also economic activity. many other advanced economies are experiencing similarly unusual conditions.    in my comments today, i will focus on the fed's efforts to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for today's unique monetary policy challenges.    the recession and recovery so far  the pandemic recession—the briefest yet deepest on record—displaced roughly 30 million workers in the space of two months.2 the decline in output in the second quarter of 2020 was twice the full decline during the great recession of 2007–09.3 but the pace of the recovery has exceeded expectations, with output surpassing its previous peak after only four quarters, less than half the time required following the great recession. as is typically the case, the recovery in employment has lagged that in output; nonetheless, employment gains have also come faster than expected.4    the economic downturn has not fallen equally on all americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. in particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on african americans and hispanics.    the unevenness of the recovery can further be seen through the lens of the sectoral shift of spending into goods—particularly durable goods such as appliances, furniture, and cars—and away from services, particularly in-person services in areas such as travel and leisure (figure 1). as the pandemic struck, restaurant meals fell 45 percent, air travel 95 percent, and dentist visits 65 percent. even today, with overall gross domestic product and consumption spending more than fully recovered, services spending remains about 7 percent below trend. total employment is now 6 million below its february 2020 level, and 5 million of that shortfall is in the still-depressed service sector. in contrast, spending on durable goods has boomed since the start of the recovery and is now running about 20 percent above the pre-pandemic level. with demand outstripping pandemic-afflicted supply, rising durables prices are a principal factor lifting inflation well above our 2 percent objective.    given the ongoing upheaval in the economy, some strains and surprises are inevitable. the job of monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and price stability as the economy works through this challenging period. i will turn now to a discussion of progress toward those goals.    the path ahead: maximum employment  the outlook for the labor market has brightened considerably in recent months. after faltering last winter, job gains have risen steadily over the course of this year and now average 832,000 over the past three months, of which almost 800,000 have been in services (figure 2). the pace of total hiring is faster than at any time in the recorded data before the pandemic. the levels of job openings and quits are at record highs, and employers report that they cannot fill jobs fast enough to meet returning demand.    these favorable conditions for job seekers should help the economy cover the considerable remaining ground to reach maximum employment. the unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 percent, a post-pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the reported rate understates the amount of labor market slack.5 long-term unemployment remains elevated, and the recovery in labor force participation has lagged well behind the rest of the labor market, as it has in past recoveries.    with vaccinations rising, schools reopening, and enhanced unemployment benefits ending, some factors that may be holding back job seekers are likely fading.6 while the delta variant presents a near-term risk, the prospects are good for continued progress toward maximum employment.    the path ahead: inflation  the rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up in inflation. over the 12 months through july, measures of headline and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have run at 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively—well above our 2 percent longer-run objective.7 businesses and consumers widely report upward pressure on prices and wages. inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for concern. but that concern is tempered by a number of factors that suggest that these elevated readings are likely to prove temporary. this assessment is a critical and ongoing one, and we are carefully monitoring incoming data.    the dynamics of inflation are complex, and we assess the inflation outlook from a number of different perspectives, as i will now discuss.    1. the absence so far of broad-based inflation pressures  the spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. durable goods alone contributed about 1 percentage point to the latest 12‑month measures of headline and core inflation. energy prices, which rebounded with the strong recovery, added another 0.8 percentage point to headline inflation, and from long experience we expect the inflation effects of these increases to be transitory. in addition, some prices—for example, for hotel rooms and airplane tickets—declined sharply during the recession and have now moved back up close to pre-pandemic levels. the 12-month window we use in computing inflation now captures the rebound in prices but not the initial decline, temporarily elevating reported inflation. these effects, which are adding a few tenths to measured inflation, should wash out over time.    we consult a range of measures meant to capture whether price increases for particular items are spilling over into broad-based inflation. these include trimmed mean measures and measures excluding durables and computed from just before the pandemic. these measures generally show inflation at or close to our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 3). we would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures were spreading more broadly through the economy.    2. moderating inflation in higher-inflation items  we are also directly monitoring the prices of particular goods and services most affected by the pandemic and the reopening, and are beginning to see a moderation in some cases as shortages ease. used car prices, for example, appear to have stabilized; indeed, some price indicators are beginning to fall. if that continues, as many analysts predict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation down, as they did for much of the past decade.8    this same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissipating and, in some cases, reversing seems likely to play out in durables more generally. over the 25 years preceding the pandemic, durables prices actually declined, with inflation averaging negative 1.9 percent per year (figure 5).9 as supply problems have begun to resolve, inflation in durable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting to fall. it seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to overall inflation. we will be looking for evidence that supports or undercuts that expectation.    3. wages  we also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. wage increases are essential to support a rising standard of living and are generally, of course, a welcome development. but if wage increases were to move materially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses would likely pass those increases on to customers, a process that could become the sort of ""wage–price spiral"" seen at times in the past.10 today we see little evidence of wage increases that might threaten excessive inflation (figure 6). broad-based measures of wages that adjust for compositional changes in the labor force, such as the employment cost index and the atlanta wage growth tracker, show wages moving up at a pace that appears consistent with our longer-term inflation objective. we will continue to monitor this carefully.    4. longer-term inflation expectations  policymakers and analysts generally believe that, as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, policy can and should look through temporary swings in inflation. our monetary policy framework emphasizes that anchoring longer-term expectations at 2 percent is important for both maximum employment and price stability.    we carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer-term inflation expectations. these measures today are at levels broadly consistent with our 2 percent objective (figure 4). because measures of inflation expectations are individually noisy, we also focus on common patterns across the measures. one approach to summarizing these patterns is the board staff's index of common inflation expectations (cie), which combines information from a broad range of survey and market-based measures.11 this index captures a general move down in expectations starting around 2014, a time when inflation was running persistently below 2 percent. more recently, the index shows a welcome reversal of that decline and is now at levels more consistent with our 2 percent objective.    longer-term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or near-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case, the fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12    5. the prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past quarter century  finally, it is worth noting that, since the 1990s, inflation in many advanced economies has run somewhat below 2 percent even in good times (figure 7). the pattern of low inflation likely reflects sustained disinflationary forces, including technology, globalization and perhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful commitment by central banks to maintain price stability.13 in the united states, unemployment ran below 4 percent for about two years before the pandemic, while inflation ran at or below 2 percent. wages did move up across the income spectrum—a welcome development—but not by enough to lift price inflation consistently to 2 percent. while the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated. it seems more likely that they will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.14    we will continue to monitor incoming inflation data against each of these assessments.    to sum up, the baseline outlook is for continued progress toward maximum employment, with inflation returning to levels consistent with our goal of inflation averaging 2 percent over time. let me now turn to how the baseline outlook and the associated risks and uncertainties figure in our monetary policymaking.    implications for monetary policy  the period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today. the early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times. the main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. if a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. the ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. we know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.16    history also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for granted that inflation due to transitory factors will fade. the 1970s saw two periods in which there were large increases in energy and food prices, raising headline inflation for a time. but when the direct effects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run persistently higher than before. one likely contributing factor was that the public had come to generally expect higher inflation—one reason why we now monitor inflation expectations so carefully.17    central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. at such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. if sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the federal open market committee (fomc) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.    incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. we also expect to see continued strong job creation. and we will be learning more about the delta variant's effects. for now, i believe that policy is well positioned; as always, we are prepared to adjust policy as appropriate to achieve our goals.    that brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for monetary policy. the committee remains steadfast in our oft-expressed commitment to support the economy for as long as is needed to achieve a full recovery. the changes we made last year to our statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy are well suited to address today's challenges.    we have said that we would continue our asset purchases at the current pace until we see substantial further progress toward our maximum employment and price stability goals, measured since last december, when we first articulated this guidance. my view is that the ""substantial further progress"" test has been met for inflation. there has also been clear progress toward maximum employment. at the fomc's recent july meeting, i was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. the intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for july, but also the further spread of the delta variant. we will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions.    the timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test. we have said that we will continue to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level until the economy reaches conditions consistent with maximum employment, and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. we have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we have reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis.    these are challenging times for the public we serve, as the pandemic and its unprecedented toll on health and economic activity linger. but i will end on a positive note. before the pandemic, we all saw the extraordinary benefits that a strong labor market can deliver to our society. despite today's challenges, the economy is on a path to just such a labor market, with high levels of employment and participation, broadly shared wage gains, and inflation running close to our price stability goal. thank you very much."
2021-09-24,4455.48,"Chair_Powell_2021-Sept-24",0.14610090402744,"nearly three years after we started holding fed listens events around the country, the program has proved to be even more valuable than we could have imagined. its original purpose was to elicit broad feedback as part of our monetary policy framework review. however, the fed has long viewed community outreach as a vital part of our economic understanding, and these discussions have delivered such value that fed listens has evolved to join the other regular staples of our outreach work.    these events enable us to hear directly from people on the ground, at the heart of the sectors and industries you represent, from communities across the country, to add tone, contour and greater depth to the nation's economic portrait. these insights are particularly valuable as we move through this challenging and precedent shattering period. the speed and intensity of this downturn – and the rapidity of the recovery in many areas – are without modern precedent.    i am very glad you could all join us today to offer your thoughts, and i want to thank you on behalf of the entire federal reserve system for both your presence today and for your continued feedback and participation.    some of the issues you are confronting are shared across sectors, while others are unique to your fields. most of you are contending with changed workplaces, from safety protocols whose half-lives are unclear to fundamental shifts in how your industries operate, in everything from feeding people to how movies are released. business plans have been reworked, outlooks have been revised, and the future continues to be tinged with uncertainty.    while uncertainty often results in immobility for businesses, it can also spell opportunity, and the creativity and adaptability on display over the past 18 months have been among the few bright spots. i have been amazed and inspired by the flexibility and ingenuity, particularly that of small businesses, in shifting to meet the demands of a new reality.    all of us are very much looking forward to the discussion today. you provide a wealth of information by sharing your experiences and those of your colleagues, customers, and communities. that has always been crucial in how we conduct monetary policy but means even more in extraordinary times such as these.    i want to thank you again for providing that insight and look forward to the conversation."
2021-11-08,4701.7,"Chair_Powell_2021-Nov-8",0.0887700557527056,"good morning. i am pleased to welcome everyone to today's conference on gender and the economy. thank you for being here, for participating, and for lending your expertise on this important topic.    we have gathered an impressive lineup of speakers and panelists, who will address a range of timely and important issues.    to open the conference, i will give a brief tour of the important research on display here, then discuss how the pandemic has affected the economy along gender lines.    research  the speakers and panelists will be exploring a wide range of topics, from a historical review of gender issues and the economy to how someone's education options—and the financing of those choices—affect that person's early career and financial stability. speakers and panelists will also be looking at the influence of family and caregiving on career advancement and will discuss timely topics of wealth and retirement.    the pandemic and gender  the pandemic widened deep-rooted inequities in our economy. along racial, gender, and socioeconomic lines, those least able to bear it, unfortunately, were those who were most affected. women make up the majority of frontline workers, who have been under substantial strain—and subject to personal risks—during the pandemic. additionally, women took on the majority of caring responsibilities, for older relatives and children alike. as schools closed and childcare services shuttered during the worst of the pandemic, that added responsibility and stress made working more difficult for some and took many away from their jobs. these burdens are real and have been an additional challenge during an already challenging time.    in a reversal of previous recessions, women suffered more from job losses in the covid-19 recession than men. in april 2020, the unemployment rate for women was 16.1 percent, compared with 13.6 percent for men. the gap persisted until september of that year, and while it has since reversed, it does not account for the many women who left the workforce entirely.1    increased childcare responsibilities during the pandemic also affected many parents' working lives. mothers of small children were more likely to exit the labor force during the pandemic compared with previous periods. these increases were larger among mothers who earned less before the pandemic.2    this issue was widespread and had significant financial consequences on many households. the federal reserve's 2020 survey of household economics and decisionmaking shows that the pandemic disrupted childcare or in-person schooling for nearly 70 percent of parents, with 25 percent of mothers reporting they did not work or worked less as a result. many faced substantial financial difficulty. only 37 percent of mothers who reported not working or working less because of childcare or schooling disruptions would cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalent.    as households and the economy continue to recover, the lessons learned during this era will help inform how policymakers and communities work to bridge those gaps. long-standing disparities weigh on the productive capacity of our economy, which can only realize its full potential if everyone has a solid chance to contribute to, and to reap the benefits of, broad-reaching prosperity.    conclusion  in closing, i want to thank you all for taking the time to join this discussion. these are vital issues not just to the economy, but to families across the country. there is more to be done, but this conference highlights the number of world-class researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who are dedicated to understanding and addressing these deeply entrenched issues.    as a group, we have an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of gender parity and diversity in our professions, in our research, and in our policymaking. thank you."
2021-11-09,4685.25,"Chair_Powell_2021-Nov-9",-0.349873450028709,"good morning. it is a pleasure to welcome you to today's discussion and to host this third conference on diversity and inclusion in economics, finance, and central banking. my colleagues and i are proud to cosponsor this conference along with the bank of canada, the bank of england, and the european central bank.    we are truly honored by this impressive array of panelists, discussants, and speakers, which include eminent research economists as well as current and former policymakers from here and around the world. we are grateful for the time, energy, and insights you have committed to this work, and we look forward to the day when we can gather together again in person.    to kick off today's discussions, i would like to touch briefly on these subjects from two distinct perspectives. first, i will discuss some of the ways we at the federal reserve approach issues of persistent economic inequities. then i will review some of how we as central banks are addressing the issues around diversity and inclusion in economics as institutions and employers.    policymaking  taking the first of these topics, we know, of course, that an economy is healthier and stronger when as many people as possible are able to work. if entrenched inequities prevent some americans from participating fully in our labor markets, not only will they be held back from opportunities, but our economy overall will not realize its potential. and those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities.    our recent history highlights both the benefits of a strong economy and the severe costs of a weak one. in the later years of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic, the benefits of employment continued to spread more widely and to reach those at the margins of the economy. prior to the pandemic, unemployment was at 50‑year lows. wages had been moving up, and meaningfully so, especially on the lower ends of the pay scale. many who had struggled for years were finding jobs. racial disparities in unemployment were narrowing.    in contrast, one of the great cruelties of the covid-19 recession is the toll it took on workers who were finally beginning to experience the benefits of a period of historically long economic growth. those same groups, unfortunately, disproportionately shouldered the brunt of the pandemic's burden.    most entrenched inequities are beyond the power of monetary policy to address. the specific goals given to us by congress, however, to foster achievement of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, form the foundation of a strong and stable economy.    it was with this in mind that my colleagues and i on the federal open market committee, as part of last year's update to the fed's monetary policy framework, defined maximum employment as a broad and inclusive goal. this innovation recognizes that a strong labor market delivers broad-reaching benefits and extends those benefits in particular to low- and moderate-income communities. while monetary policy does not target any particular group of people, when we assess whether we are at maximum employment, we purposely look at a wide range of indicators, and we are attentive to disparities in the labor market, rather than just the headline numbers.    diversity and inclusion play a role in policymaking as well. as policymakers working on behalf of the entire public, we benefit greatly by seeking out and listening to the perspectives and experiences of people who represent the diverse landscape of the economy. we regularly meet with a broad range of groups as we assess the economy. and as we worked to update our monetary policy framework, we hosted a series of listening events across the country before and during the pandemic, and these conversations factored importantly into our thinking and our new framework.    diversity in economics  next, i would like to turn to an issue facing many of us at this conference—namely, how central banks as institutions and employers grapple with and confront diversity and inclusion within economics. collectively, we are among the largest employers in the field of economics, which both affects our own workplaces and affords us an opportunity to help influence and shape the evolution of the profession.    throughout my career, in both the public and the private sectors, i have seen that the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that have a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion. these organizations consistently attract the best talent, by investing in and retaining a world-class workforce.    i know that the central banks represented here today are indeed working diligently to do just that. at the fed, we are hosting events like this one, where high-quality economic research is brought to bear. we are working to foster an inclusive workplace environment where staff can feel comfortable at work and to promote a similarly inclusive culture within the profession. we are working to broaden our reach by recruiting at historically black colleges and universities and hispanic-serving institutions, as well as by hosting events to promote career opportunities at the fed.    my colleagues and i know that both the opportunities and the challenges are great and that the work is never truly done. whether you are a researcher bringing your analytical skills to bear, or you are on the front lines of improving the diversity of the economics pipeline, or perhaps you are in an institution where you are redoubling your efforts to attract diverse talent, your endeavors are making a difference. as a group, we are fortunate to have opportunities like this to reaffirm the importance of diversity in our professions, in our research, and in our policymaking, and i am glad that we are here today to continue this work. thank you."
2021-11-29,4655.27,"Chair_Powell_2021-Nov-29",1.32002211281892,"good afternoon. it is a pleasure to welcome everyone, including colleagues from the bank for international settlements (bis) and in particular from the bis innovation hub, to the opening of the new york innovation center.    the pace of technological change and innovation over the last decade has led some to argue that we are on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution—a digital revolution. certainly, rapid innovation, including through the application of advanced digital technologies, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data, is revolutionizing the financial sector. the federal reserve has a mandate to understand and, in some cases, manage these changes, but it also has a responsibility to be at the forefront of change to deliver to the american people—and the international community—a reliable, efficient, and inclusive monetary and financial system.    furthering the efforts around the federal reserve system to harness the power of innovation, i am delighted to welcome the opening of the new york innovation center. located at the federal reserve bank of new york, in the heart of the most important financial center in the world, this innovation center will draw on the expertise at the bank, in the federal reserve system, and from the broader financial community, as well as experts around the world to analyze and bring technology to bear on improving the global financial system.    increasing the synergies of the new york innovation center will be its strategic partnership with the bis innovation hub, recently established to foster dialogue, collaboration and knowledge-sharing among central banks and other authorities and institutions. in particular, the partnership will support our analysis of digital currencies—including central bank digital currencies; help to improve our current payment system—with a particular focus on making cross-border payments faster and less expensive; and it will provide new tools to aid our supervision of the financial system.    linking up with the bis in this way will enhance our ability to collaborate with central banks around the world and will ensure that the best and most up-to-date information, research, and practices are flowing freely. since its inception in january 2020, i have served as head of the bis innovation hub advisory committee and am very pleased that the federal reserve will be able to partner with the hub in this important way.    so i want to extend my thanks to president williams, agustin carstens, and all those that worked on the establishment of this center. and i look forward to the advances of both these institutions in supporting innovation in service to the safety and soundness of the financial system.    thank you."
2022-03-21,4461.18,"Chair_Powell_2022-Mar-21",-0.0434673501944738,"thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.    let me first pause to recognize the millions who are suffering the tragic consequences of russia's invasion of ukraine.    at the federal reserve, our monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. from that standpoint, the current picture is plain to see: the labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high. my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. there is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability. we are committed to restoring price stability while preserving a strong labor market.    at our meeting that concluded last week, we took several steps in pursuit of these goals: we raised our policy interest rate for the first time since the start of the pandemic and said that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to reach our objectives. we also said that we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting. in my press conference, i noted that action could come as soon as our next meeting in may, though that is not a decision that we have made. these actions, along with the adjustments we have made since last fall, represent a substantial firming in the stance of policy with the intention of restoring price stability. in my comments today, i will first discuss the economic conditions that warrant these actions and then address the path ahead for monetary policy.    the labor market is very strong and extremely tight  to begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion that ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an extended period of strong labor market conditions. we seek to foster another long expansion in order to realize those benefits again.    the labor market has substantial momentum. employment growth powered through the difficult omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months. the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, near historical lows, and has reached this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1). while disparities in employment remain, job growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and demographic groups.    by many measures, the labor market is extremely tight, significantly tighter than the very strong job market just before the pandemic. there are far more job openings going unfilled today than before the pandemic, despite today's unemployment rate being higher. indeed, there are a record 1.7 posted job openings for each person who is looking for work. record numbers of people are quitting jobs each month, typically to take another job with higher pay. and nominal wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, with the gains strongest for those at the lower end of the wage distribution and among production and nonsupervisory workers (figure 2).    it is worth considering why the labor market is so tight, given that the unemployment rate is actually higher than it was before the pandemic. one explanation is that the natural rate of unemployment may be temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is greater for any given level of unemployment. the sheer volume of hiring may have taxed the capacity of the market to bring workers and jobs together. the delta and omicron variants complicated hiring, and the strong financial position of households may have allowed some to be more selective in their job search. over time, we might expect these factors to fade, reducing pressure in the job market.    a second source of labor market tightness is that the labor force participation rate dropped sharply in the pandemic and has only partly recovered. as a result, the labor force remains below its pre-pandemic trend (figure 3). total demand for labor, measured by total employment plus posted job openings, has substantially recovered and far exceeds the size of the workforce.    about half of the shortfall in labor force participation is attributable to retirements during the pandemic.1 history suggests that most of those retirees are unlikely to reenter the workforce. but some nonparticipation is due to factors that may fade with time, such as caregiving needs and fear of contracting covid-19. with prime-aged participation still well below its pre-pandemic level, there is room for further progress. a more complete rebound is, however, likely to take some time. increases in labor force participation often substantially lag declines in unemployment.    overall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and demand. our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term, but in a long expansion, the factors holding back supply will likely ease. in the meantime, we aim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued, sustainable increases in employment and wages.    the inflation outlook has deteriorated significantly  turning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated significantly this year even before russia's invasion of ukraine.    the rise in inflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters generally expected. for example, at the time of our june 2021 meeting, every federal open market committee (fomc) participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the survey of professional forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 percent. inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2    for a time, moderate inflation forecasts looked plausible—the one-month headline and core inflation rates declined steadily from april through september. but inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and, just since our december meeting, the median fomc projection for year-end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.    why have forecasts been so far off? in my view, an important part of the explanation is that forecasters widely underestimated the severity and persistence of supply-side frictions, which, when combined with strong demand, especially for durable goods, produced surprisingly high inflation.    the pandemic and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused a serious upheaval in many parts of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in services demand. the combination of the surge in goods demand with supply chain bottlenecks led to sharply rising goods prices (figure 4). the most notable example here is motor vehicles. prices soared across the vehicles sector as booming demand was met by a sharp decline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer chips. production remains below pre-pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in prices has been repeatedly postponed.    many forecasters, including fomc participants, had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely available.3 expectations were that the supply-side damage would begin to heal. schools would reopen—freeing parents to return to work—and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures. while schools are open, none of the other expectations has been fully met. part of the reason may be that, contrary to expectations, covid has not gone away with the arrival of vaccines. in fact, we are now headed once again into more covid-related supply disruptions from china. it continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain. in the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.    the policy response  as the magnitude and persistence of the increase in inflation became increasingly clear over the second half of last year, and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond expectations, the fomc pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy. in june, the median fomc participant projected that the federal funds rate would remain at its effective lower bound through the end of 2022, and as the news came in, the projected policy paths shifted higher (figure 5). the median projection that accompanied last week's 25 basis point rate increase shows the federal funds rate at 1.9 percent by the end of this year and rising above its estimated longer-run normal value in 2023. the latest fomc statement also indicates that the committee expects to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting. i believe that these policy actions and those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.    as always, our policy projections are not a committee decision or fixed plan. instead, they are a summary of what the fomc participants see as the most likely case going forward. the events of the past four weeks remind us that, in tumultuous times, what seems like the most likely scenario may change quite quickly: each summary of economic projections reflects a point in time and can become outdated quickly at times like these, when events are developing rapidly.    thus, my main message today is that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust policy as needed in order to ensure a return to price stability with a strong job market. let me now turn to three questions about the likely evolution of policy.    how will fallout from the invasion of ukraine affect the economy and monetary policy? russia's invasion of ukraine may have significant effects on the world economy and the u.s. economy. the magnitude and persistence of these effects remain highly uncertain and depend on events yet to come.    russia is one of the world's largest producers of commodities, and ukraine is a key producer of several commodities as well, including wheat and neon, which is used in the production of computer chips. there is no recent experience with significant market disruption across such a broad range of commodities. in addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the u.s. economy.    we might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s—not a happy story. fortunately, the united states is now much better situated to weather oil price shocks.4 we are now the world's largest producer of oil, and our economy is significantly less oil intensive than in the 1970s. today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally. on net, oil shocks tend to weigh on output in the u.s. economy, but by far less than in the 1970s.    second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower inflation without causing a recession? our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion and sustaining a strong labor market. in the fomc participant projections i just described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and unemployment holding steady. growth slows as the very fast growth from the early stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy accommodation is removed.    some have argued that history stacks the odds against achieving a soft landing, and point to the 1994 episode as the only successful soft landing in the postwar period. i believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common in u.s. monetary history.5 in three episodes—in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the fed raised the federal funds rate significantly in response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6 in other cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions were not apparently due to excessive tightening of monetary policy. for example, the tightening from 2015 to 2019 was followed by the pandemic-induced recession.7    i hasten to add that no one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context—very little is straightforward in the current context. and monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision. my colleagues and i will do our very best to succeed in this challenging task. it is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.    finally, what will it take to restore price stability? the ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the federal reserve. price stability is essential if we are going to have another sustained period of strong labor market conditions. i believe that the policy approach that i have laid out is well suited to achieving this outcome. we will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. in particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. and if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.    our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, emphasizes that having longer-term inflation expectations anchored at our longer-run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our dual-mandate objectives. while we cannot measure longer-term expectations directly, we monitor a variety of survey- and market-based indicators. in the recent period, short-term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation, but longer-run expectations remain well anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).    the added near-term upward pressure from the invasion of ukraine on inflation from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation. in normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks. however, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the committee to move expeditiously as i have described.    conclusion  the past two years have been extraordinarily challenging for many americans. two years ago, more than 20 million people were losing their jobs, millions were falling ill, and lives were being disrupted. we have made enormous strides since then. today, as i have discussed, the labor market is very strong. but, to end where i began, inflation is much too high. we have the necessary tools, and we will use them to restore price stability."
2022-05-24,3941.48,"Chair_Powell_2022-May-24",-0.812079270210758,"good morning, and welcome. it is a great pleasure to welcome all the attendees to res 2022.    the national center for american indian enterprise development has been a strong and consistent partner to the federal reserve, collaborating with us on small business covid surveys, serving on the leadership council for the minneapolis fed’s center for indian country development, and moderating our policy webinar series on tribal enterprise diversification, just to name a few.    trust is earned and developed through relationships. this is particularly important in indian country. the federal reserve has built an enduring and sturdy bond with the national center, and we value that partnership.    we are excited to be participating in this year’s conference, learning alongside you. there is undoubtedly more research and engagement to be done on the specific and unique economic needs of tribal nations and indigenous communities. res 2022 is a great meeting ground for such collaboration.    the best insight and analysis come from people who live and work in communities and have an inside view of the struggles and opportunities within. the federal reserve system has made a priority of engaging with leaders and stakeholders on opportunities most relevant to tribal economic prosperity. for example, input from tribal stakeholders has been invaluable to informing the important work of modernizing the community reinvestment act, which was incorporated into the recently published proposal that we are looking forward to getting comments on. we also value the growing representation of tribal voices on our boards of directors and advisory councils at reserve banks, helping us to better understand economic conditions in indian country.    many of you are aware of the center for indian country development (cicd), our national institute dedicated to helping tribes reach their full economic potential. we are excited to be expanding its capacity to conduct economic research and data analysis to support the long-term economic prosperity of indian country, in partnership with indian country. we look forward to cicd’s ongoing collaboration with tribal communities on research and data.    additionally, an initial st. louis fed partnership with the osage nation, to provide youth financial education, has led to partnerships with tribal governments across the country that provide personal finance education, often in their native languages. tribal leaders nationwide have also joined recent listening sessions to discuss the impacts of inflation. similar sessions were held on our pandemic response facilities, which were adapted after hearing their input.    other federal reserve partnerships with indian country include initiatives on access to credit; native community development financial institutions; financial education programs tailored to early childhood, secondary, and higher education; workforce development; housing; social services; and elder programs.    and as part of our ongoing effort to deepen our understanding of tribal economies, last year, the federal reserve board announced that we had joined the central bank network for indigenous inclusion, along with the reserve bank of new zealand, the bank of canada, and the reserve bank of australia. this is part of our commitment to learning best practices and expanding our international partnerships with central banks that are similarly invested in supporting indigenous people and communities.    the federal reserve works for all of us, and our research and analysis must reflect the specific needs and circumstances of all of our communities. i am grateful for our partnership with the national center for american indian enterprise development, and i want to thank you, as well as all our colleagues, advisors, and stakeholders who help us work toward a stable and inclusive economy for all.    thank you."

system that emerged after world war ii has been defined by the centrality of the dollar. it is the world's reserve currency and the most widely used for payments and investments. as outlined in recent work by board staff, this global preeminence has been supported by the depth and liquidity of u.s. financial markets, the size and strength of the u.s. economy, its stability and openness to trade and capital flows, and international trust in u.s. institutions and the rule of law.1 professor barry eichengreen will expand on some of these themes later this morning.    the dollar's international role holds multiple benefits. for the united states, it lowers transaction fees and borrowing costs for u.s. households, businesses, and the government. its ubiquity helps contain uncertainty and, relatedly, the cost of hedging for domestic households and businesses. for foreign economies, the wide use of the dollar allows borrowers to have access to a broad pool of lenders and investors, which reduces their funding and transaction costs. the benefits of the dollar as the dominant reserve currency have generated an extensive academic literature. yesterday's paper on the treasury market by alexandra tabova and frank warnock extends that work in meaningful ways.    the federal reserve's strong commitment to our price stability mandate contributes to the widespread confidence in the dollar as a store of value. to that end, my colleagues and i are acutely focused on returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. meeting our dual mandate also depends on maintaining financial stability. the fed's commitment to both our dual mandate and financial stability encourages the international community to hold and use dollars.    the wide use of the dollar globally can also pose financial stability challenges that can materially affect households, businesses, and markets. for that reason, the federal reserve has played a key role in promoting financial stability and supporting the use of dollars internationally through our liquidity facilities. the central bank liquidity swap lines provide foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver u.s. dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions. and the foreign and international monetary authorities (fima) repo facility allows approved fima account holders the option to temporarily exchange their u.s. treasury securities held by the federal reserve for u.s. dollars. these facilities serve as liquidity backstops so that holders of dollar assets and participants in dollar funding markets can be confident that strains will be eased when these markets come under stress. that assurance, in turn, mitigates the effect of such strains on the flow of credit to u.s. households and businesses. both facilities enhance the standing of the dollar as the dominant global currency.    the swap lines were extensively used during the global financial crisis, the 2011 euro-area debt crisis, and the financial turmoil at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. the paper on central bank swap lines presented yesterday by gerardo ferrara, philippe mueller, ganesh viswanath-natraj, and junxuan wang provides novel micro-level evidence on the usefulness of swap lines in providing cross-border liquidity to support the real economy.    looking forward, rapid changes are taking place in the global monetary system that may affect the international role of the dollar in the future. most major economies already have or are in the process of developing instant, 24/7 payments. our own fednow service will be coming online in 2023. and in light of the tremendous growth in crypto-assets and stablecoins, the federal reserve is examining whether a u.s. central bank digital currency (cbdc) would improve on an already safe and efficient domestic payments system. as the fed's white paper on this topic notes, a u.s. cbdc could also potentially help maintain the dollar's international standing.2 as we consider feedback from the paper, we will be thinking not just about the current state of the world, but also how the global financial system might evolve over the next 5 to 10 years. the paper by jiakai chen and asani sarkar, which is on today's program, and our distinguished panelists on this topic this afternoon, will provide important insights on this issue.    to summarize, i would like to stress the importance of the dollar to the u.s. and global economies and financial markets. it is critical that we understand the channels, connections, and effects of the role of the dollar.    in closing, i want to thank you all for taking the time to join our discussion on the dollar's international roles. this conference brings together world-class researchers, practitioners, and policymakers dedicated to understanding and addressing these vital issues. i look forward to their insights and i hope you enjoy the conference."
2022-08-26,4057.66,"Chair_Powell_2022-Aug-26",-3.36880108213149,"thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.    at past jackson hole conferences, i have discussed broad topics such as the ever-changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy under high uncertainty. today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct.    the federal open market committee's (fomc) overarching focus right now is to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. in particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. the burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them.    restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth. moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. while higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.    the u.s. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. while the latest economic data have been mixed, in my view our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum. the labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. inflation is running well above 2 percent, and high inflation has continued to spread through the economy. while the lower inflation readings for july are welcome, a single month's improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.    we are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. at our most recent meeting in july, the fomc raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent, which is in the summary of economic projection's (sep) range of estimates of where the federal funds rate is projected to settle in the longer run. in current circumstances, with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run neutral are not a place to stop or pause.    july's increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings, and i said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting. we are now about halfway through the intermeeting period. our decision at the september meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook. at some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.    restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. committee participants' most recent individual projections from the june sep showed the median federal funds rate running slightly below 4 percent through the end of 2023. participants will update their projections at the september meeting.    our monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned about inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 1980s, and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter-century. in particular, we are drawing on three important lessons.    the first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation. it may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former chairman ben bernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the great inflation period.1 today, we regard these questions as settled. our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional. it is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the united states. it is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the united states is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the fed's tools work principally on aggregate demand. none of this diminishes the federal reserve's responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. there is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. we are committed to doing that job.    the second lesson is that the public's expectations about future inflation can play an important role in setting the path of inflation over time. today, by many measures, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. that is broadly true of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, and of market-based measures as well. but that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our goal for some time.    if the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will. unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of high and volatile inflation. during the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and businesses. the more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions. as former chairman paul volcker put it at the height of the great inflation in 1979, ""inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations.""2    one useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention.""3 when inflation is persistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate inflation into their economic decisions. when inflation is low and stable, they are freer to focus their attention elsewhere. former chairman alan greenspan put it this way: ""for all practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions.""4    of course, inflation has just about everyone's attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.    that brings me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is done. history shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. the successful volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. a lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.    these lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down. we are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. we will keep at it until we are confident the job is done."
2022-09-28,3719.04,"Chair_Powell_2022-Sept-28",1.96721401369236,"good morning, and welcome to the 10th annual community banking research conference. i have attended this conference twice before, including the first one back in 2013, and i can attest to the quality of the research and discussions. while i am coming to you virtually today, many of you are gathering in person for the first time in three years. i am sure it will make an excellent event even more enjoyable.    the community banking research conference brings together researchers, regulators, policymakers, and community bankers to discuss the unique and important role community banks play in our economy. the conference was launched in the years following the financial crisis, in a collaboration by the federal reserve, the conference of state bank supervisors (csbs), and the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic). the conference was developed to deepen our understanding of the community bank business model and to provide a forum to discuss research with academics, policymakers, regulators, and community bankers.    the research presented over the years has informed supervisory and regulatory policy debates and continues to challenge our thinking. it has highlighted the vital links between community banks and small businesses, the availability of credit in low- and moderate-income communities, how community banks support their local communities in times of crisis, and the impact of technology.    a critical feature of the research sessions is that community bankers join academic moderators to provide feedback from a practitioner's perspective. the challenges facing community banks have changed significantly over the past 10 years. community banks have demonstrated remarkable resilience, and conferences like this have helped regulators and supervisors to better understand those changes.    i want to congratulate the federal reserve bank of st. louis for a decade of hosting an important and informative conference.    and i want to thank our colleagues at the fed, the fdic, and the conference of state bank supervisors. on a sadder note, i want to recognize the passing of john ryan, who was president of the csbs, this past may. john's impact on the csbs and his contributions to the financial services sector overall were significant, and he is missed by all who knew and worked with him.    thanks also to the researchers and all the community banking professionals for their insight and contributions over the years.    thank you all, and have a great conference."
2022-11-30,4080.11,"Chair_Powell_2022-Nov-30",3.09478147275011,"today i will offer a progress report on the federal open market committee's (fomc) efforts to restore price stability to the u.s. economy for the benefit of the american people. the report must begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation remains far too high. my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation is imposing significant hardship, straining budgets and shrinking what paychecks will buy. this is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. in particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.    we currently estimate that 12-month personal consumption expenditures (pce) inflation through october ran at 6.0 percent (figure 1).1 while october inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. as figure 1 makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. it will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. by any standard, inflation remains much too high.    for purposes of this discussion, i will focus my comments on core pce inflation, which omits the food and energy inflation components, which have been lower recently but are quite volatile. our inflation goal is for total inflation, of course, as food and energy prices matter a great deal for household budgets. but core inflation often gives a more accurate indicator of where overall inflation is headed. twelve-month core pce inflation stands at 5.0 percent in our october estimate, approximately where it stood last december when policy tightening was in its early stages. over 2022, core inflation rose a few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below, but it mainly moved sideways. so when will inflation come down?    i could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private-sector forecasters or of fomc participants, which broadly show a significant decline over the next year. but forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year, while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways. the truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain. for now, let's put aside the forecasts and look instead to the macroeconomic conditions we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.    for starters, we need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. there is considerable uncertainty about what rate will be sufficient, although there is no doubt that we have made substantial progress, raising our target range for the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points since march. as our last postmeeting statement indicates, we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. it seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the september meeting and summary of economic projections. i will return to policy at the end of my comments, but for now, i will simply say that we have more ground to cover.    we are tightening the stance of policy in order to slow growth in aggregate demand. slowing demand growth should allow supply to catch up with demand and restore the balance that will yield stable prices over time. restoring that balance is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth.    last year, the ongoing reopening of the economy boosted real gross domestic product (gdp) growth to a very strong 5.7 percent. this year, gdp was roughly flat through the first three quarters, and indicators point to modest growth this quarter, which seems likely to bring the year in with very modest growth overall. several factors contributed to this slowing growth, including the waning effects of reopening and of pandemic fiscal support, the global implications of russia's war against ukraine, and our policy actions, which tightened financial conditions and are affecting economic activity, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing. we can say that demand growth has slowed, and we expect that this growth will need to remain at a slower pace for a sustained period.    despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year, we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation. to assess what it will take to get inflation down, it is useful to break core inflation into three component categories: core goods inflation, housing services inflation, and inflation in core services other than housing (figure 2).    core goods inflation has moved down from very high levels over the course of 2022, while housing services inflation has risen rapidly. inflation in core services ex housing has fluctuated but shown no clear trend. i will discuss each of these items in turn.    early in the pandemic, goods prices began rising rapidly, as abnormally strong demand was met by pandemic-hampered supply. reports from businesses and many indicators suggest that supply chain issues are now easing. both fuel and nonfuel import prices have fallen in recent months, and indicators of prices paid by manufacturers have moved down. while 12-month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4.6 percent, it has fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year. it is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished, but if current trends continue, goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months.    housing services inflation measures the rise in the price of all rents and the rise in the rental-equivalent cost of owner-occupied housing. unlike goods inflation, housing services inflation has continued to rise and now stands at 7.1 percent over the past 12 months. housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points, however, because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over.2 the market rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will go over the next year or so. measures of 12-month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear (figure 3).    as figure 3 shows, however, overall housing services inflation has continued to rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the higher level of rents for new leases. this is likely to continue well into next year. but as long as new lease inflation keeps falling, we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling sometime next year. indeed, a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of declining inflation.    finally, we come to core services other than housing. this spending category covers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and hospitality. this is the largest of our three categories, constituting more than half of the core pce index. thus, this may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation. because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services, the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category.    in the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers, and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.3 thus, another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.    signs of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid-2021. the unemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3.5 percent that had prevailed without major signs of tightness before the pandemic. employment was still millions below its level on the eve of the pandemic. looking back, we can see that a significant and persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic—a shortfall that appears unlikely to fully close anytime soon.    comparing the current labor force with the congressional budget office's pre-pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3-1/2 million people (figure 4, left panel).4 this shortfall reflects both lower-than-expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate (figure 4, right panel). participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic because of many factors, including sickness, caregiving, and fear of infection. many forecasters expected that participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded. and for workers in their prime working years, it mostly has. overall participation, however, remains well below pre-pandemic trends.    some of the participation gap reflects workers who are still out of the labor force because they are sick with covid-19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from previous covid infections (""long covid"").5 but recent research by fed economists finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements—that is, retirements in excess of what would have been expected from population aging alone.6 these excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 3‑1/2 million shortfall in the labor force.7    what explains these excess retirements? health issues have surely played a role, as covid has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly.8 in addition, many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic, when layoffs were historically high. the cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers, given pandemic-related disruptions to the work environment and health concerns.9 also, gains in the stock market and rising house prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that likely facilitated early retirement for some people.    the data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind because of retirees returning to the labor force. older workers are still retiring at higher rates, and retirees do not appear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees.10    the second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working-age population. the combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1-1/2 million missing workers.11    policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the fed: our tools work principally on demand. without advocating any particular policy, however, i will say that policies to support labor force participation could, over time, bring benefits to the workers who join the labor force and support overall economic growth. such policies would take time to implement and have their effects, however. for the near term, a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market.    currently, the unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, near 50-year lows, and job openings exceed available workers by about 4 million—that is about 1.7 job openings for every person looking for work (figure 5). so far, we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand. with slower gdp growth this year, job gains have stepped down from more than 450,000 per month over the first seven months of the year to about 290,000 per month over the past three months. but this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time—about 100,000 per month by many estimates. job openings have fallen by about 1.5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic.    wage growth, too, shows only tentative signs of returning to balance. some measures of wage growth have ticked down recently (figure 6). but the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. to be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. but for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.    let's sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent. growth in economic activity has slowed to well below its longer-run trend, and this needs to be sustained. bottlenecks in goods production are easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well, and this, too, must continue. housing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year, but if inflation on new leases continues to fall, we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year. finally, the labor market, which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing, shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.    returning to monetary policy, my fomc colleagues and i are strongly committed to restoring price stability. after our november meeting, we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2 percent over time.    monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down. the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting. given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level. it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. we will stay the course until the job is done."
2023-01-10,3919.25,"Chair_Powell_2023-Jan-10",0.69782558985018,"i will address three main points. first, the federal reserve's monetary policy independence is an important and broadly supported institutional arrangement that has served the american public well. second, the fed must continuously earn that independence by using our tools to achieve our assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability, and by providing transparency to facilitate understanding and effective oversight by the public and their elected representatives in congress. third, we should ""stick to our knitting"" and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.    central bank independence and transparency  on the first point, the case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-term political considerations.1 price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time. but restoring price stability when inflation is high can require measures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the economy. the absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors. i believe that the benefits of independent monetary policy in the u.s. context are well understood and broadly accepted.2    in a well-functioning democracy, important public policy decisions should be made, in almost all cases, by the elected branches of government. grants of independence to agencies should be exceedingly rare, explicit, tightly circumscribed, and limited to those issues that clearly warrant protection from short-term political considerations.    with independence comes the responsibility to provide the transparency that enables effective oversight by congress, which, in turn, supports the fed's democratic legitimacy. at the fed, we treat this as an active, not passive, responsibility, and over the past several decades we have steadily broadened our efforts to provide meaningful transparency about the basis for, and consequences of, the decisions we make in service to the american public. we are tightly focused on achieving our statutory mandate and on providing useful and appropriate transparency.3    sticking to our mandate  it is essential that we stick to our statutory goals and authorities, and that we resist the temptation to broaden our scope to address other important social issues of the day.4 taking on new goals, however worthy, without a clear statutory mandate would undermine the case for our independence.    in the area of bank regulation, too, the fed has a degree of independence, as do the other federal bank regulators. independence in this area helps ensure that the public can be confident that our supervisory decisions are not influenced by political considerations.5 today, some analysts ask whether incorporating into bank supervision the perceived risks associated with climate change is appropriate, wise, and consistent with our existing mandates.    addressing climate change seems likely to require policies that would have significant distributional and other effects on companies, industries, regions, and nations. decisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected branches of government and thus reflect the public's will as expressed through elections.    at the same time, in my view, the fed does have narrow, but important, responsibilities regarding climate-related financial risks. these responsibilities are tightly linked to our responsibilities for bank supervision.6 the public reasonably expects supervisors to require that banks understand, and appropriately manage, their material risks, including the financial risks of climate change.    but without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to use our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate-based goals.7 we are not, and will not be, a ""climate policymaker.""    references"
2023-06-29,4396.44,"Chair_Powell_2023-Jun-29",0.447352668351282,"today i will briefly discuss the current economic situation and the stresses that emerged in the u.s. banking system earlier this year. i will then turn to the evolution of the financial system since the great recession and conclude with a few general observations. i will highlight how global efforts to boost resilience in the financial sector over the past decade have been an important success. i will also discuss how recent developments have revealed residual vulnerabilities that we are going to address, and the need to be vigilant for emerging risks.    u.s. economic growth slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, and some indicators in the housing market have turned up recently. at the same time, activity in the housing sector remains far below its peak in early 2022, reflecting the effects of higher mortgage rates. higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.    the labor market remains very tight. over the past three months, payroll job gains have been robust. the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance, including higher labor force participation, some easing in nominal wage growth, and declining vacancies. while the jobs-to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.    inflation, however, remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. over the 12 months ending in may, total personal consumption expenditures (pce) prices are estimated to have risen 3.9 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core pce prices likely rose 4.7 percent. inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.    since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points. we see the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. it will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.    the economy is also facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. tighter credit conditions are a natural result of tighter monetary policy. but the bank stresses that emerged in march may well lead to a further tightening in credit conditions. the extent of these effects remains uncertain.    at our last meeting, the federal open market committee (fomc) decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent while continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. we made this decision in light of the distance we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags in monetary policy, and the potential headwinds from credit tightening. as noted in the fomc's summary of economic projections, a strong majority of committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates two or more times by the end of the year.1    when bank stress emerged in march, we acted in concert with other government agencies to address it, enabling the federal deposit insurance corporation to resolve two failed banks in a manner that protected all depositors. we also used our liquidity tools to make funding available to banks that might need it. in addition to our discount window, we established a new facility under our emergency lending authorities, the bank term funding program. our provision of liquidity through these tools supported the stability of the financial system without restricting the use of our monetary policy tools to firm the stance of policy as part of our efforts to reduce inflation. the banking system remains sound and resilient, deposit flows have stabilized, and strains have eased.    evolution of the system since the great recession  a little more than a decade ago, the global financial crisis required extraordinary interventions by governments around the world. stabilizing the u.s. financial system required coordinated efforts by all parts of the government, including $700 billion in taxpayer funds to recapitalize banks, a suite of fed emergency liquidity facilities, as well as government guarantees on bank transaction accounts and money market mutual funds. despite these efforts, the great recession brought misery to countless millions.    as the crisis slowly receded, authorities in the u.s. and around the world implemented a host of reforms. the goal was to build a system that could withstand severe shocks, including unanticipated ones that might arrive from any direction. in other words, a financial system that would be a source of strength during stressful periods.    a key pillar was building resilience in the banking system. this effort was remarkably successful. over the course of the decade, capital and liquidity at the largest u.s. banks more than doubled. we began a program of rigorous annual stress tests to ensure the banking system was capitalized against severe recessions and financial market turmoil.    the great recession also underscored the critical importance of the nonbank sector. here, too, the authorities have undertaken a number of steps to build resilience, although much remains to be done.    in 2020 the financial system was again tested, facing a truly unprecedented shock as the pandemic brought the global economy to a standstill. investors scrambled for safety and liquidity during the ""dash for cash."" financial markets came under extreme pressure. ultimately, the authorities had to support financial markets again as part of the extremely forceful monetary and fiscal response to the public health emergency. the banking system, however, was now far more resilient than it had been before the reforms and thus well positioned to absorb the shock.    we cannot take the resilience of the financial system for granted, however. the multiple shocks we have seen over the past year or so—including the extreme volatility in commodity markets following russia's invasion of ukraine and, of course, surprisingly high and persistent inflation as well as the associated increase in interest rates—stressed a range of bank and nonbank financial institutions.    three general observations stemming from the recent banking turmoil  given the efforts to build resilience in the banking system over the past decade and a half, two natural questions are, why did silicon valley bank (svb) and two other sizable u.s. banks fail this spring, and why did credit suisse—a global systemically important bank (g-sib)—require a government-supported rescue acquisition? we are committed to learning the lessons from the u.s. bank failures for our program of supervision and regulation. i will offer three observations about the events.    the first observation is that it is very difficult to resist the natural human tendency to fight the last war. in 2008 we saw banks come under stress from outsized credit losses and insufficient liquidity. such losses appeared possible in the early days of the 2020 crisis, although they ultimately did not materialize. in our stress tests, we have considered severe stress scenarios that produced losses on banks' books, including outsized credit losses. but, of course, svb's vulnerability came not from credit risk, but from excessive interest rate risk exposure and a business model that was vulnerable in ways its management did not fully appreciate, including a heavy reliance on uninsured deposits.    these events suggest a need to strengthen our supervision and regulation of institutions of the size of svb. i look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes and implementing them where appropriate.2 much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always tradeoffs in any financial regulation. in addition, the u.s. has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.    the second observation is the value of forthrightly recognizing when a crisis is building and responding decisively. when svb failed it was clear that a number of standard assumptions, even though they were informed by hard experience, were wrong. notably, bank runs were no longer a matter of days or weeks—they could now be nearly instantaneous. fortunately, in concert with other parts of the government, we were able to act decisively to meet the liquidity needs of the banking system, protect depositors, and limit contagion.    the third observation is the value of having the very largest banks be highly resilient. our regulatory system is much stronger for the substantial additional safeguards we have built around the g-sibs since the great recession. they are subject to capital surcharges, required to be highly liquid, and held to the highest supervisory standards. the events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid.    conclusion  the great recession was a watershed moment, demonstrating the terrible consequences a fragile financial system can have on people's lives. in response, regulators in the u.s. and around the globe set out to build a much more resilient financial system. and the ensuing experiences of the pandemic and the past few months did much to validate this approach.    the bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance. we therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system's resilience. and building and maintaining that resilience requires collaboration. the system was able to withstand recent shocks because of the efforts by regulators and legislators, including our international counterparts in the globally interconnected financial system.    we will take these lessons on board, and we will keep learning, as we must, because the work of building and maintaining a resilient financial system is never done."
2023-08-25,4405.71,"Chair_Powell_2023-Aug-25",0.671798844231776,"good morning. at last year's jackson hole symposium, i delivered a brief, direct message. my remarks this year will be a bit longer, but the message is the same: it is the fed's job to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal, and we will do so. we have tightened policy significantly over the past year. although inflation has moved down from its peak—a welcome development—it remains too high. we are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.    today i will review our progress so far and discuss the outlook and the uncertainties we face as we pursue our dual mandate goals. i will conclude with a summary of what this means for policy. given how far we have come, at upcoming meetings we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.    the decline in inflation so far  the ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. by the time the federal open market committee raised the policy rate in march 2022, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up. while these two forces are now working together to bring down inflation, the process still has a long way to go, even with the more favorable recent readings.    on a 12-month basis, u.s. total, or ""headline,"" pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation peaked at 7 percent in june 2022 and declined to 3.3 percent as of july, following a trajectory roughly in line with global trends (figure 1, panel a).1 the effects of russia's war against ukraine have been a primary driver of the changes in headline inflation around the world since early 2022. headline inflation is what households and businesses experience most directly, so this decline is very good news. but food and energy prices are influenced by global factors that remain volatile, and can provide a misleading signal of where inflation is headed. in my remaining comments, i will focus on core pce inflation, which omits the food and energy components.    on a 12-month basis, core pce inflation peaked at 5.4 percent in february 2022 and declined gradually to 4.3 percent in july (figure 1, panel b). the lower monthly readings for core inflation in june and july were welcome, but two months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. we can't yet know the extent to which these lower readings will continue or where underlying inflation will settle over coming quarters. twelve-month core inflation is still elevated, and there is substantial further ground to cover to get back to price stability.    to understand the factors that will likely drive further progress, it is useful to separately examine the three broad components of core pce inflation—inflation for goods, for housing services, and for all other services, sometimes referred to as nonhousing services (figure 2).    core goods inflation has fallen sharply, particularly for durable goods, as both tighter monetary policy and the slow unwinding of supply and demand dislocations are bringing it down. the motor vehicle sector provides a good illustration. earlier in the pandemic, demand for vehicles rose sharply, supported by low interest rates, fiscal transfers, curtailed spending on in-person services, and shifts in preference away from using public transportation and from living in cities. but because of a shortage of semiconductors, vehicle supply actually fell. vehicle prices spiked, and a large pool of pent-up demand emerged. as the pandemic and its effects have waned, production and inventories have grown, and supply has improved. at the same time, higher interest rates have weighed on demand. interest rates on auto loans have nearly doubled since early last year, and customers report feeling the effect of higher rates on affordability.2 on net, motor vehicle inflation has declined sharply because of the combined effects of these supply and demand factors.    similar dynamics are playing out for core goods inflation overall. as they do, the effects of monetary restraint should show through more fully over time. core goods prices fell the past two months, but on a 12-month basis, core goods inflation remains well above its pre-pandemic level. sustained progress is needed, and restrictive monetary policy is called for to achieve that progress.    in the highly interest-sensitive housing sector, the effects of monetary policy became apparent soon after liftoff. mortgage rates doubled over the course of 2022, causing housing starts and sales to fall and house price growth to plummet. growth in market rents soon peaked and then steadily declined (figure 3).3    measured housing services inflation lagged these changes, as is typical, but has recently begun to fall. this inflation metric reflects rents paid by all tenants, as well as estimates of the equivalent rents that could be earned from homes that are owner occupied.4 because leases turn over slowly, it takes time for a decline in market rent growth to work its way into the overall inflation measure. the market rent slowdown has only recently begun to show through to that measure. the slowing growth in rents for new leases over roughly the past year can be thought of as ""in the pipeline"" and will affect measured housing services inflation over the coming year. going forward, if market rent growth settles near pre-pandemic levels, housing services inflation should decline toward its pre-pandemic level as well. we will continue to watch the market rent data closely for a signal of the upside and downside risks to housing services inflation.    the final category, nonhousing services, accounts for over half of the core pce index and includes a broad range of services, such as health care, food services, transportation, and accommodations. twelve-month inflation in this sector has moved sideways since liftoff. inflation measured over the past three and six months has declined, however, which is encouraging. part of the reason for the modest decline of nonhousing services inflation so far is that many of these services were less affected by global supply chain bottlenecks and are generally thought to be less interest sensitive than other sectors such as housing or durable goods. production of these services is also relatively labor intensive, and the labor market remains tight. given the size of this sector, some further progress here will be essential to restoring price stability. over time, restrictive monetary policy will help bring aggregate supply and demand back into better balance, reducing inflationary pressures in this key sector.    the outlook  turning to the outlook, although further unwinding of pandemic-related distortions should continue to put some downward pressure on inflation, restrictive monetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role. getting inflation sustainably back down to 2 percent is expected to require a period of below-trend economic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions.    economic growth  restrictive monetary policy has tightened financial conditions, supporting the expectation of below-trend growth.5 since last year's symposium, the two-year real yield is up about 250 basis points, and longer-term real yields are higher as well—by nearly 150 basis points.6 beyond changes in interest rates, bank lending standards have tightened, and loan growth has slowed sharply.7 such a tightening of broad financial conditions typically contributes to a slowing in the growth of economic activity, and there is evidence of that in this cycle as well. for example, growth in industrial production has slowed, and the amount spent on residential investment has declined in each of the past five quarters (figure 4).    but we are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected. so far this year, gdp (gross domestic product) growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust. in addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up. additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.    the labor market  the rebalancing of the labor market has continued over the past year but remains incomplete. labor supply has improved, driven by stronger participation among workers aged 25 to 54 and by an increase in immigration back toward pre-pandemic levels. indeed, the labor force participation rate of women in their prime working years reached an all-time high in june. demand for labor has moderated as well. job openings remain high but are trending lower. payroll job growth has slowed significantly. total hours worked has been flat over the past six months, and the average workweek has declined to the lower end of its pre-pandemic range, reflecting a gradual normalization in labor market conditions (figure 5).    this rebalancing has eased wage pressures. wage growth across a range of measures continues to slow, albeit gradually (figure 6). while nominal wage growth must ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation, what matters for households is real wage growth. even as nominal wage growth has slowed, real wage growth has been increasing as inflation has fallen.    we expect this labor market rebalancing to continue. evidence that the tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could also call for a monetary policy response.    uncertainty and risk management along the path forward  two percent is and will remain our inflation target. we are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time. it is challenging, of course, to know in real time when such a stance has been achieved. there are some challenges that are common to all tightening cycles. for example, real interest rates are now positive and well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate. we see the current stance of policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. but we cannot identify with certainty the neutral rate of interest, and thus there is always uncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint.    that assessment is further complicated by uncertainty about the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation. since the symposium a year ago, the committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis points, including 100 basis points over the past seven months. and we have substantially reduced the size of our securities holdings. the wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.    beyond these traditional sources of policy uncertainty, the supply and demand dislocations unique to this cycle raise further complications through their effects on inflation and labor market dynamics. for example, so far, job openings have declined substantially without increasing unemployment—a highly welcome but historically unusual result that appears to reflect large excess demand for labor. in addition, there is evidence that inflation has become more responsive to labor market tightness than was the case in recent decades.8 these changing dynamics may or may not persist, and this uncertainty underscores the need for agile policymaking.    these uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little. doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment. doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.    conclusion  as is often the case, we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies. in such circumstances, risk-management considerations are critical. at upcoming meetings, we will assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving outlook and risks. based on this assessment, we will proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data. restoring price stability is essential to achieving both sides of our dual mandate. we will need price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.    we will keep at it until the job is done."
2023-09-28,4299.7,"Chair_Powell_2023-Sept-28",0.589307312417086,"thank you, sarah, thank you to those in fed education who helped put together this event, and thank you to the teachers here and online who have put aside some of their planning time to listen and, i hope, also participate. if i were doing the grading, credit would always be granted for participation.    we have scheduled this discussion with teachers well into the school year, partly to highlight the beginning, on october 1, of economic education month. at the fed, every month is economic education month, and we are glad to join in the celebration.    it is, fortunately, a very different time for teachers than the one we faced in august 2021, the last time we held this discussion with educators. in the crisis of the pandemic, teachers were on the front lines. i know how overwhelming this challenge was for many of you, and the extent of your sacrifice, for which i thank you.    and the crisis in many ways continues, as research confirms the educational deficits that students still suffer from the pandemic. in addition to the challenges they face, there are likely to be consequences for the economy and for society, in a generation of young people who may lack some of what they need to be well-informed and engaged participants in our economy and our democracy. addressing this legacy of the pandemic is a major public policy challenge, so now more than ever, teachers are crucial to america's future.    a large majority of you are economic educators, a role that is of particular importance. as many of you know, the fed's ability to influence the economy depends to some extent on influencing the public's view of current and future economic conditions. when my colleagues and i publish our projections for the most likely path for the economy and interest rates, as we did a couple of weeks ago, one of our goals is to influence spending and investment decisions today and in the months ahead. that will only be the case if people understand what we are saying and what it means for their own finances.    that's where you come in. by educating students about economics, not only are you providing them with valuable skills to manage their finances, and to improve their chances for future success in any number of occupations that draw on economic thinking. you are also giving them the knowledge that they need to understand the macroeconomy, including the implications of decisions that the fed makes. economic educators impart knowledge that is instrumental in how the federal reserve promotes a healthy economy. in a way, when you are teaching students, you are also conducting monetary policy.    but you do a lot more than that. teachers illuminate the world for us. they help us to see the limitless possibilities in life, and as much as that, also in ourselves. at a wonderful but also very vulnerable time in each of our lives, teachers like you are there to help us understand the world, especially when it is hard to understand. i will leave you with one of the many examples i could cite from my time in school. i can clearly recall one november day, in fifth grade, at blessed sacrament school here in washington, d.c. my teacher mrs. keller was called away from class. i adored mrs. keller, and when she returned to the room, i think every student was as upset as i was to see her tear-streaked face. and then we got the news—president john f. kennedy had been shot and killed in dallas. this was something that was very hard for my classmates and me to understand, but mrs. keller pulled herself together and convinced us that, somehow, everything was going to be all right. teachers are there for all of us, when we need your knowledge, your example, your encouragement, and your care. thank you for playing the indispensable role you do in our lives, and in our children's lives. and now, i would be very happy to respond to your questions."
2023-10-19,4278,"Chair_Powell_2023-Oct-19",-0.848282575441533,"before our discussion, i will take a few minutes to discuss recent economic data and the outlook for monetary policy.    recent economic data  incoming data over recent months show ongoing progress toward both of our dual mandate goals—maximum employment and stable prices.    inflation  by the time the federal open market committee (fomc) raised rates in march 2022, it was clear that restoring price stability would require both the unwinding of pandemic-related distortions to supply and demand, and also restrictive monetary policy to cool strong demand and give supply time to catch up. these forces are now working together to bring inflation down.    after peaking at 7.1 percent in june 2022, 12-month headline pce (personal consumption expenditure) inflation is estimated at 3.5 percent through september.1 core pce inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, provides a better indicator of where inflation is heading. twelve-month core pce inflation peaked at 5.6 percent in february 2022 and is estimated at 3.7 percent through september.    inflation readings turned lower over the summer, a very favorable development. the september inflation data continued the downward trend but were somewhat less encouraging. shorter-term measures of core inflation over the most recent three and six months are now running below 3 percent. but these shorter-term measures are often volatile. in any case, inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. we cannot yet know how long these lower readings will persist, or where inflation will settle over coming quarters. while the path is likely to be bumpy and take some time, my colleagues and i are united in our commitment to bringing inflation down sustainably to 2 percent.    the labor market  in the labor market, strong job creation has met a welcome increase in the supply of workers, due to both higher participation and a rebound of immigration to pre-pandemic levels.2 many indicators suggest that, while conditions remain tight, the labor market is gradually cooling. job openings have moved well down from their highs and are now only modestly above pre-pandemic levels. quits are back to pre-pandemic levels, and the same is true of the wage premium earned by those who change jobs.3 surveys of workers and employers show a return to pre-pandemic levels of tightness.4 and indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.5    growth  to date, declining inflation has not come at the cost of meaningfully higher unemployment—a highly welcome development, but a historically unusual one. healing of supply chains in conjunction with the rebalancing of demand and supply in the labor market has allowed disinflation without substantially weaker economic activity. indeed, economic growth has consistently surprised to the upside this year, as most recently seen in the strong retail sales data released earlier this week. forecasters generally expect gross domestic product to come in very strong for the third quarter before cooling off in the fourth quarter and next year. still, the record suggests that a sustainable return to our 2 percent inflation goal is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some further softening in labor market conditions.6    geopolitical tensions are highly elevated and pose important risks to global economic activity. our institutional role at the federal reserve is to monitor these developments for their economic implications, which remain highly uncertain. speaking for myself, i found the attack on israel horrifying, as is the prospect for more loss of innocent lives.    monetary policy  turning to monetary policy, the fomc has tightened policy substantially over the past 18 months, increasing the federal funds rate by 525 basis points at a historically fast pace and decreasing our securities holdings by roughly $1 trillion. the stance of policy is restrictive, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. given the fast pace of the tightening, there may still be meaningful tightening in the pipeline.    my colleagues and i are committed to achieving a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. we are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor. additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.    along with many other factors, actual and expected changes in the stance of monetary policy affect broader financial conditions, which in turn affect economic activity, employment and inflation. financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening. we remain attentive to these developments because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy.    conclusion  my colleagues and i remain resolute in our commitment to returning inflation to 2 percent over time. a range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little. doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment. doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.    given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully. we will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.    thank you. i look forward to our conversation."
2023-10-25,4186.77,"Chair_Powell_2023-Oct-25",-1.43395924363417,"i am delighted and honored to introduce professor alan blinder as this year's winner of the daniel patrick moynihan prize.    the moynihan prize honors those who ""champion the use of informed judgment to advance the public good.""1 in the field of economics, i can think of no better example of such a champion than alan blinder. the very heart of his distinguished career has been advancing the use of informed judgment in economic policymaking.    as alan has observed, in our political economy, there exist two neighboring tribes, sharing common interests but separated by cultural and language barriers. on one side of the border there is the academy, particularly social scientists, who work to assess the costs and benefits of public policies, actual and possible. on the other side are the policymakers, including elected officials as well as those who work at various government agencies. folks on the academy side generally feel that the policymakers would make better policy if they paid more attention to academic work. meanwhile, policymakers often look across that divide desiring that academic work pay more attention to the practical realities of policymaking.    like moynihan himself, alan blinder is that rare person who both transcends this barrier and recognizes its significance. as he made clear to the senate during his confirmation process to become vice chair of the federal reserve, ""academic economists are often aloof from practical policy debates; but i have not been.""2 and he has regularly called on his academic colleagues to ""train their powerful tools on real-world issues instead of chasing intellectual will-o'-the-wisps.""3    alan's academic work is a testimony to those principles. he has used the powerful tools of economics to address the critical policy topics of our time. from his pathbreaking work on the great stagflation of the 1970s,4 through his analysis of central bank structure, independence, and communications,5 to his research on financial crises6 and his masterful summary of the past 60 years of monetary and fiscal policy,7 alan's work is always policy relevant, rigorous, and crystal clear.    alan has also been a top monetary policymaker, in addition to advising presidents, fed chairs and numerous other officials on both a formal and informal basis. but his work goes beyond his excellence as a member of both the academic and policymaker tribes.    alan's life's work has featured a continuous effort to foster greater understanding and communication across the divide. to illustrate this, i will close with two broad categories of engagement that have been hallmarks of alan's career.    the first is alan's work addressing the academy–policy divide itself. two of his books, published 30 years apart, show his career-long focus answering this question: how can social science, and particularly economics, support good public policies? first in hard heads, soft hearts, he articulates the problems these groups have in communicating and working with each other. he provides guidance and examples of success and failure while advocating an economic philosophy that combines ""profound respect for the virtues of free markets with profound concern for those the market leaves behind.""8 he restated that philosophy more recently in advice and dissent, in which he catalogs his own experience trying to bridge that gap, outlines what that experience has taught him, and gives additional direction ""toward more useful economic advice met by less political dissent.""9    the second category is alan's engagement with the broader american public. he is the rare public figure who speaks fluently in both english and ""economics,"" and both audiences rightly consider him a native speaker. a natural teacher, alan has communicated clearly and accessibly over the years with a wide range of audiences, bringing to bear facts, insights and lessons from history and policymaking. his countless newspaper columns, broadcast interviews and many books do more than clearly explain the economic issues of the day. through them, alan has managed to make economics both fascinating and essential to an extraordinarily wide audience. that is doubtless due in part to his habit of serving up the substance with a healthy dose of humor. whether it is an academic article on the economics of brushing teeth,10 a dinner talk outlining critical issues for central bankers with the help of gilbert and sullivan,11 or the general wit on display in any of his regular columns, alan's style enlivens even the most technical and dry topics. moynihan surely would have approved.    a personal note. over the span of four decades, and counting, for many policymakers from different sectors of the political forest, and for me personally, alan blinder has been a friend, a source of good advice, a supporter, an insightful critic, a role model, and a wise soul. in short, a mensch. his published writings as an academic economist are essential to our work, and beyond count. the same is true of the friendships he has forged. he embodies so much of what many policymakers aspire to in his commitment to hard-headed analysis, tempered by a soft heart, that supports good public policy that benefits all americans.    thank you. i am delighted and honored to introduce professor alan blinder of princeton university, this year's winner of the daniel patrick moynihan prize."
2023-11-08,4382.78,"Chair_Powell_2023-Nov-8",0.100493789940563,"thank you, stacey, for the chance to be part of this celebration. it is great to be here to honor the division of research and statistics (r&s) and humbling to see so many fed people who served the institution over long and distinguished careers and have returned for this great occasion. the fed is one of those places where you can work for a decade or so and still feel like a newbie.    for those listening outside this room, i will briefly outline r&s's responsibilities. a large part of the division, along with other divisions at the board, is engaged in producing the tealbook, which contains the staff's forecast for the u.s. economy, as well as a great deal of data and analysis on financial and economic issues, and which is delivered to the federal open market committee (fomc) before our meetings.    outside of the fomc meeting cycle, r&s deploys its experts wherever they are needed across the board, providing crucial inputs to work on financial stability, bank merger analysis, and many other topics. r&s is also an ongoing source of specialized information for policymakers. if board members have questions about even the most arcane workings of some aspect of the economy, they can send an email and, in no time, be sitting down with some of the best-informed experts on that subject. much of the time, these are r&s economists. during the pandemic, when questions arose about how the computer chip shortage was affecting auto production or how businesses were responding to the backlog at u.s. ports, r&s gave detailed briefings on these topics. among its other activities, the board of governors is one of the world's most productive economic research institutions, and a large share of that work takes place inside r&s, supporting our mission of promoting a healthy economy and a strong and stable financial system.    i've spoken about research—now let me turn to statistics. in addition to the gathering of data from many sources outside the federal reserve, r&s is itself the source for some of the most important data on the economy and the financial system. our consumer credit data provide financial markets and the public with a vital indicator of the strength of household spending and balance sheets. each month, the industrial production report gives us insights into how well certain sectors of the economy, especially in the manufacturing realm, are operating. r&s is also responsible for the financial accounts of the united states, a quarterly compendium of assets, liabilities, and transactions for different segments of the economy. and every three years, r&s conducts the survey of consumer finances, a premier source of detail and insights about how households are faring in the economy. the latest survey was published just last month. these and other data series produced by r&s are a significant public service.    i want to focus in more detail on the forecast, perhaps the most important of r&s's roles. the u.s. economy baseline forecast produced by r&s, along with the simulation of a half-dozen plausible alternative paths, constitutes the largest part of the essential bedrock that enables our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals.    some people are attracted to extremely challenging tasks. the people of r&s are those people, having chosen such a task in forecasting the path of the u.s. economy, eight times a year for fomc meetings, with ongoing updates between meetings. they do this work on the biggest stage and with the highest stakes, knowing that the economy very often surprises us.    several qualities are required to do this work well.    i will start with an intense commitment. the work requires everything you have to give. you have to love this work to do it well.    the job also requires integrity—policymakers count on r&s to give us their best thinking, not shading the results for any reason.    regular forecasting also demands a systematic approach and a high degree of intellectual rigor. ask stacey and her colleagues to explain a certain aspect of the forecast, and you will find that they have a clear explanation grounded in a rigorous framework.    that intellectual rigor has to be combined with flexibility and agility. economic models can do a reasonably good job of capturing the working of the economy over past decades. of course, even with state-of-the-art models and even in relatively calm times, the economy frequently surprises us. but our economy is flexible and dynamic, and subject at times to unpredictable shocks, such as a global financial crisis or a pandemic. at those times, forecasters have to think outside the models.    this work also takes large doses of courage and humility. and, finally, judgment. to complement this rigorous process, there has to be good judgment, based on knowledge and experience.    perhaps the most important legacy of the past century for the division of research and statistics is the resilience, the creativity, the energy, the rigor, and the commitment with which r&s has risen to the many challenges it and our country have faced in that span of history. on behalf of the board and the fomc, thank you for that, and hearty congratulations on your first 100 years of service to the public."
2023-11-09,4347.35,"Chair_Powell_2023-Nov-9",-0.808391021223958,"thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's panel discussion. my assigned topic is u.s. monetary policy in the current global inflation episode. i will briefly address the u.s. outlook and then turn to three broader questions raised by the historic events of the pandemic era.    u.s. inflation has come down over the past year but remains well above our 2 percent target (figure 1).1 my colleagues and i are gratified by this progress but expect that the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. the labor market remains tight, although improvements in labor supply and a gradual easing in demand continue to move it into better balance.2 gross domestic product growth in the third quarter was quite strong, but, like most forecasters, we expect growth to moderate in coming quarters. of course, that remains to be seen, and we are attentive to the risk that stronger growth could undermine further progress in restoring balance to the labor market and in bringing inflation down, which could warrant a response from monetary policy. the federal open market committee (fomc) is committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance. we know that ongoing progress toward our 2 percent goal is not assured: inflation has given us a few head fakes. if it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so. we will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening. we are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. we will keep at it until the job is done.    with that, i will turn to three questions that have arisen from the receding but still elevated inflation we are experiencing today. the first question is, with the benefit of 2‑1/2 years to look back, what we can say about the initial causes and ongoing policy implications of the current inflation.    after running below our 2 percent target over the first year of the pandemic, core pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rose sharply in march 2021. economic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the february 2021 survey of professional forecasters, which showed core pce inflation running at or below target over the subsequent three years.3 the real-time questions for policymakers were what caused the high inflation and how policy should react. at the outset, many forecasters and analysts, including fomc participants, viewed the sudden upturn in inflation as mostly a function of pandemic-related shifts in the composition of demand, a disruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply. the resulting supply and demand imbalances led to large increases in the prices of a range of items most directly affected by the pandemic, especially goods. in this view, as the pandemic abated, our dynamic and flexible economy was likely to adapt fairly quickly. supply disruptions and shortages would diminish. labor supply would rebound, aided by the arrival of vaccines and the reopening of schools. elevated demand for goods would shift back to services. inflation would ease reasonably quickly without the need for a significant policy response.4    indeed, although monthly core pce inflation spiked in march and april of 2021, beginning in may it declined for five consecutive months, providing some support for this view (figure 2). but in the fourth quarter of 2021, the data clearly changed amid waves of new covid-19 variants, with only gradual progress in restoring global supply chains, and relatively few workers rejoining the labor force. that lack of progress, combined with very strong demand from households, contributed to a tight economy and a historically tight labor market, and more persistent high inflation.    the committee signaled a change in our policy approach, and financial conditions began to tighten. a new shock arrived in february 2022, when russia invaded ukraine, resulting in a sharp increase in energy and other commodity prices. when we lifted off in march, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend both on the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up. today, these two processes are working together to bring inflation down. the fomc has raised the federal funds rate target range by 5-1/4 percentage points and reduced our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. monetary policy is in restrictive territory and putting downward pressure on demand and inflation.    the unwinding of pandemic-related supply and demand distortions is playing an important role in the decline of inflation. for example, wage growth has steadily fallen by most measures since mid-2022 (figure 3), despite continued robust job gains, reflecting a resurgence in labor supply thanks to higher labor force participation and a return of immigration to pre-pandemic levels.    while the broader supply recovery continues, it is not clear how much more will be achieved by additional supply-side improvements. going forward, it may be that a greater share of the progress in reducing inflation will have to come from tight monetary policy restraining the growth of aggregate demand.5    turning to my second question, for many years, it has been generally thought that monetary policy should limit its response to, or ""look through,"" supply shocks to the extent that they are temporary and idiosyncratic.6 many argue as well that, in the future, supply disruptions are likely to be more frequent or more persistent than in the decades just before the pandemic.7 a second question, then, is what we have learned about the standard ""looking through"" approach.    the idea that the response to the inflationary effects of supply shocks should be attenuated arises, in part, from the tradeoff presented by those shocks. supply shocks tend to move prices and employment in opposite directions, whereas monetary policy pushes each in the same direction. therefore, the response of monetary policy to higher prices stemming from an adverse supply shock should be attenuated because it would otherwise amplify the unwanted decline in employment.8 in addition, supply shocks have most frequently come from the volatile food and energy categories and have passed quickly. while food and energy prices critically affect the budgets of households and businesses, the policy tools of central banks work more slowly than commodity markets move. responding aggressively to quickly passing price increases could exacerbate macroeconomic volatility without supporting price stability.    our experience since 2020 highlights some limits of that thinking. to begin with, it can be challenging to disentangle supply shocks from demand shocks in real time, and also to determine how long either will persist, particularly in the extraordinary circumstances of the past three years. supply shocks that have a persistent effect on potential output could call for restrictive policy to better align aggregate demand with the suppressed level of aggregate supply. the sequence of shocks to global supply chains experienced from 2020 to 2022 suppressed output for a considerable time and may have persistently altered global supply dynamics. such a sequence calls on policymakers to use policy restraint to limit inflationary effects.    policy restraint in this case is also good risk management. supply shocks that drive inflation high enough for long enough can affect the longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses. monetary policy must forthrightly address any risks of a potential de-anchoring of inflation expectations, as well-anchored expectations help facilitate bringing inflation back to our target. the sharp policy tightening during 2022 likely contributed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.    my third question is the level where interest rates will settle once the effects of the pandemic are truly behind us. by 2019, the general level of nominal interest rates had declined steadily over several decades (figure 4). as the pandemic arrived, many advanced economies had below-target inflation and low or mildly negative policy rates, raising difficult questions about the efficacy of interest rate policy when constrained by the effective lower bound (elb). over two decades, an extensive literature had identified a number of possible changes to the widely used inflation-targeting regime, including negative policy rates, nominal income targeting, and various forms of makeup strategies under which persistent shortfalls in inflation would be followed by a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent.9 today, inflation and policy rates are elevated, and the elb is not currently relevant for our policy decisions. but it is too soon to say whether the monetary policy challenges of the elb will ultimately turn out to be a thing of the past.    the prolonged proximity of interest rates to the elb was at the heart of the monetary policy review and the changes we made to our framework in 2020. we will begin our next five-year review in the latter half of 2024 and announce the results about a year later. among the questions we will consider is the degree to which the structural features of the economy that led to low interest rates in the pre-pandemic era will persist. with time, we will continue to learn from the experience of the past few years, and what implications it may hold for monetary policy.    these are just three of the many questions raised by these challenging times, and we are far from a complete understanding of the answers. i appreciate the opportunity to discuss these issues with you today and look forward to our conversation."
2023-12-01,4594.63,"Chair_Powell_2023-Dec-1",0.587372476903541,"thank you, president gayle, and thank you for the invitation to visit today. i am fortunate to have been accompanied from washington by a very distinguished graduate of spelman college, class of 1986 and member of delta sigma theta, my federal reserve colleague governor lisa cook. there is no greater testament to spelman's historic legacy than the achievements of outstanding women like governor cook. one part of that legacy is spelman's tradition of promoting education in stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). governor cook's research highlights the key role of such education in preparing individuals to be inventors and innovators who can generate ideas that will add to our body of knowledge, increase productivity, and generate higher living standards.1 her work is just one example of how spelman women continue to make historic contributions in science, the arts, technology, medicine, and other fields.    i look forward to our conversation, and i thought i might frame it by talking about the federal reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy, and how those actions relate to questions students in this audience may be asking about the future. for example, i am sure that students are wondering what kind of a job market and economy you will be entering when you complete your education.    congress assigned the fed the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. both goals are essential aspects of a healthy economy. congress also gave the fed a precious grant of independence from direct political control to allow us to pursue those goals without consideration of political matters. other major central banks in democratic societies have similar grants of independence, and this institutional arrangement has a strong track record of producing better policy outcomes for the benefit of the public.    to begin with our maximum employment goal, i am glad to say that, by many measures, conditions in the labor market are very strong. a couple of years ago, as the pandemic receded and the economy reopened, the number of job openings grew to greatly exceed the supply of people available to work, leaving a widespread shortage of workers. today, labor market conditions remain very strong, and the economy is returning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers. the pace at which the economy is creating new jobs remains strong, and has been slowing toward a more sustainable level. that gradual slowing has come in part due to the efforts of the fed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation. after declining sharply during the pandemic, the supply of workers has bounced back, as people have come back into the labor force and as immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. partly because of that labor force growth, the unemployment rate has edged up over the second half of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent. the increase in participation has been particularly strong among women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, which surged to an all-time high earlier this year, and which remains well above pre-pandemic levels. wage growth remains high but has been gradually moving toward levels that would be more consistent with 2 percent price inflation over time, and real wages are growing again as inflation declines.    as for price stability, the federal open market committee (fomc) has a longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation.2 after running below 2 percent for over a decade, inflation increased sharply in 2021, in the united states and in many other countries around the world. high inflation imposes a significant hardship on all households and is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. beginning in early 2022, we reacted forcefully, raising our policy interest rate and decreasing the size of our balance sheet to help slow the economy and bring down inflation. inflation has declined to 3 percent over the 12 months ending in october, but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, what we call ""core"" inflation is still 3.5 percent, well above our 2 percent objective.    over the six months ending in october, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective. high inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. the normalization of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the disinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overall financial conditions over the past two years.3 the strong actions we have taken have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. monetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely not yet been felt. the forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped maintain the fed's hard-won credibility, ensuring that the public's expectations of future inflation remain well-anchored. having come so far so quickly, the fomc is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced.4    as the demand- and supply-related effects of the pandemic continue to unwind, uncertainty about the outlook for the economy is unusually elevated. like most forecasters, my colleagues and i anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as restrictive monetary policy weighs on aggregate demand.5 the fomc is strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. it would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease. we are prepared to tighten policy further if it becomes appropriate to do so.    we are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.    that is an overview of what my colleagues and i at the fed are trying to accomplish. the bottom line, if you are a student, is that we have made considerable progress in reducing high inflation while maintaining a strong labor market, with a lot of opportunity for new graduates. the unemployment rate has risen a bit, but it is still very low by historical standards, and by many measures it is a great time to start your career. you will face challenging decisions soon about what professions to enter, and what companies and institutions to work for. some of you will become entrepreneurs. you have already made one really good decision, and that is coming to spelman. whatever opportunities and challenges emerge, education will continue to be a key to success. higher education is an investment, and not just of money. you are investing your time and great effort to gain knowledge and skills that are preparing you for successful careers. your success will make for a stronger economy. for our part, at the fed we are doing our best to foster an economy that gives you the best opportunity to succeed. with that, i will hand it back to you, president gayle."
