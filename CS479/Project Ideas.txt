Questions:

1) Metadata is data about data but is the data only the data (I think) will be used in my analysis. For example the title or date of a speech I'm performing sentiment analysis on, would they be metadata? The file type the data is stored in is metadata.
2) Are we doing exploratory data analysis for the individual assignments or a full on project. I don't know if my topic would be good for that.
