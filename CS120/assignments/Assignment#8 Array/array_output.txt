This is a program which does things with arrays based off user input.
Enter a positive number for what length you want the array to be: 10
Enter a number for the first bound of the number: 10
Enter a number for the second bound of the number: -10
Array: Array: -4.816, -5.38, -9.46, 4.444, 2.294, 5.409, -4.936, 8.158, 0.756, -9.395
Average of the data in the array: -1.2926
Lowest value from data in the array: -9.46
Highest value from data in the array: 8.158
What value would you like to add to the values in the array: 0
Array after values are added: Array: -4.816, -5.38, -9.46, 4.444, 2.294, 5.409, -4.936, 8.158, 0.756, -9.395
New average of the data in the array: -1.2926
Number of values less than the average: 5
Number of values more than the average: 5
Next, you will enter a value and will be shown how many values of the array are less than that value.
Enter a value: 0
Number of values less than the threshold value: 5
Range of the array: 17.618
Standard deviation of the array: 5.9912
